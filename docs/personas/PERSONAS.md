# Murmurant Personas
Copyright (c) Santa Barbara Newcomers Club

This document defines the primary user personas for Murmurant. These personas represent typical members, volunteers, and leaders of the Santa Barbara Newcomers Club. Most have moved to Santa Barbara within the last 18 months, spend at least six months per year in town, and have been members for two to three years. Many take leadership roles in part to qualify for extended membership.

All personas are non-technical. They do not write code, manage servers, or maintain databases. Design, documentation, and the user interface must be clear, simple, and written in everyday language.

Images below are placeholders. Each image file should be stored at:

## Final Notes

These personas should guide:

- System design  
- UI language  
- Documentation tone  
- Permissions and workflows  
- Error messages  
- Onboarding and training  
- In-app help and guidance  

Every feature of Murmurant should be testable against these personas. The system should remain understandable by non-technical users and maintainable by future volunteers or a contractor following the documentation.
