# ClubOS - Runbooks (Pre-Deployment)

Status: Canonical Runbook Set
Applies to: Pre-deployment readiness and incident preparedness
Last updated: 2025-12-21

These runbooks define human-executable procedures for operating ClubOS safely
during failure conditions.

These runbooks are documentation and rehearsal artifacts only.

They MUST NOT:
- Enable production mechanisms
- Execute backups
- Perform restores
- Configure infrastructure
- Assume monitoring, alerts, or on-call rotation exists

All steps are human-directed and must be logged in a Decision Log.
