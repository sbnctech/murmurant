# Murmurant - Work Queue (Backlog)

Status: Canonical backlog
Last updated: 2025-12-28

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## B. Reliability R3 (Stubs + CI Wiring) - Pre-deployment readiness

B1. ✅ COMPLETE - Implement inert mechanism stubs (NO enabling)
- Implemented: src/lib/reliability/ (guards, killSwitch, isolation, backpressure, backup, failureInjection)
- Tests: tests/unit/reliability/ (103 tests)
- All stubs are inert (always allow, no-op)

B2. ✅ COMPLETE - CI merge gates (usage enforcement only; no activation)
- Implemented: scripts/ci/check-reliability-guardrails.ts
- Checks: required docs, module exports, guard adoption tracking, mechanism matrix
- Wired into: npm run test:guardrails

B3. ✅ COMPLETE - Update MECHANISM_STUBS_AND_OWNERSHIP.md
- Updated: 8 mechanisms moved from Defined → Stubbed
- Last updated: 2025-12-28

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## C. Reliability Enablement (Later; not before deployment decision)

C1. Audit log real storage + retention (append-only, attributable)
C2. Read-only mode implementation (actual write blocking, not policy only)
C3. Publish freeze implementation (server-side)
C4. Real backpressure/rate limiting (bounded, visible)
C5. Dependency isolation (timeouts/circuit behavior)
C6. Backup execution (real), PITR/WAL, immutable storage, access controls
C7. Restore verification suite (runs invariants against restored dataset)
C8. Failure injection execution plan (staging first, then controlled prod)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## D. Operations (Runbooks, table tops, governance)

D1. Assign provisional owners for production-critical mechanisms (pre-deployment)
D2. Run at least 2 table tops (TT1, TT2) with written outcomes
D3. Create Go/No-Go declaration template for deployment decision
D4. Define incident log storage location and retention (even if manual)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## E. Infra and Resilience (Later; separate decision)

E1. Environment strategy (dev/staging/prod separation)
E2. Database resilience strategy (provider choice, PITR, failover posture)
E3. Observability stack (logs/metrics/traces) and alert routing
E4. Disaster recovery exercise plan (restore drills with verification)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## F. Migration Path (WA as Source of Truth)

Strategy: Use Murmurant UI while Wild Apricot remains the system of record.
This enables gradual user migration with minimal risk.

F1. ✅ COMPLETE - Migration architecture spec
- Spec: docs/ARCH/MIGRATION_INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md
- Defines: Read-through caching, write-through with confirmation, conflict resolution
- Authority matrix: WA vs MM authoritative per entity per stage
- Sync: Real-time (on-demand), near-real-time (5 min polling), nightly reconciliation
- Failure handling: Retry, queue, graceful degradation
- Cutover criteria: Technical, operational, stakeholder checklists

F2. ✅ COMPLETE - WA API proxy layer
- Implemented: src/lib/wa/ (types, config, security, audit, client, webhooks)
- Features: Typed client with auto-pagination, rate limiting, input validation
- Security: Credential protection, sensitive data redaction, webhook signatures
- Audit: Full operation logging with PII protection
- Tests: tests/unit/wa/ (95 tests)
- Docs: docs/ARCH/WA_API_SECURITY.md

F3. 🔄 IN PROGRESS - Member data read-through
- Goal: MM reads member data from WA, caches locally for performance.
- Implemented: src/lib/wa/memberSync.ts (cache layer, read-through, background sync)
- Features: TTL-based caching (5 min default), staleness indicators, manual refresh
- Tests: tests/unit/wa/memberSync.spec.ts (35 tests)
- Remaining: Staleness indicator UI components, integration with member pages

F4. Event/registration write-through
- Goal: Event registrations in MM UI write to WA as source of truth.
- Deliverables: Registration API that proxies to WA, confirms success.
- Must include: Rollback on WA failure, clear error messages.

F5. Gradual cutover plan
- Goal: Define criteria and process for migrating entity types to MM-authoritative.
- Deliverables: Cutover checklist, rollback procedures, data validation suite.
- Must include: Per-entity migration (members, events, pages separate).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Parallelization Plan (Official)

Safe parallel streams (now):

- Stream 1: Reliability R3 stubs + CI wiring (B1/B2/B3)
  - Rule: stubs MUST be inert (default allow). No enabled behavior.

- Stream 2: Editor Phase 1 (A1) - block ordering UI wiring + tests
  - Rule: no drag-and-drop, no lifecycle orchestration, no publish plumbing.

- Stream 3: Publishing specs (A3 + A5) - docs/spec only
  - Rule: no runtime changes required in this stream.

- Stream 4: Ops/governance readiness (D1/D2/D3/D4) - docs only

Not parallelized yet / gated:
- Editor drag-and-drop (A2) waits for A1 completion.
- Reliability enablement (C*) requires explicit deployment posture decision.
- Migration path (F*) requires F1 architecture spec approval before implementation.

Coordination rules:
- One PR per stream.
- Avoid simultaneous edits to docs/backlog/WORK_QUEUE.md (treat as append-only or coordinate).
- CI/workflows are owned by Stream 1.
