# Mentor Role Definition

## Mission

Convert nervous newcomers into confident participants.

## Who Mentors Are

Mentors are members who:

- Have been in the club at least one year
- Attend events regularly
- Want to help others feel welcome
- Remember what it felt like to be new

Mentors are **not**:

- Club historians required to know everything
- Social butterflies (introverts make excellent mentors)
- Committed to a fixed time investment
- Formally trained counselors

## What Mentors Do

### Required

1. **Make first contact** within one week of assignment
   - Introduce yourself by email or phone
   - Share one thing you wish you'd known when you joined
   - Let them know you're available for questions

2. **Attend at least one event together** in the first month
   - Offer to meet at an event they're interested in
   - Introduce them to a few people
   - Check in afterwards

### Encouraged

- Watch for their registration on events you're attending
- Send a "thinking of you" note before big club events
- Share your own experiences as a newcomer
- Celebrate their first volunteer shift

### Not Required

- Become best friends
- Attend every event with them
- Solve their personal problems
- Continue mentoring forever

## Success Indicators

A mentorship is working when the newbie:

- Attends a second event
- Talks to someone besides their mentor
- Registers for something on their own
- Asks a question (any question)

A mentorship is complete when the newbie:

- Feels comfortable attending events alone
- Has met people outside their mentor relationship
- Has been in the club 6-12 months
- Expresses interest in volunteering (bonus!)

## Time Commitment

Realistic expectations:

| Activity | Time |
|----------|------|
| Initial email/call | 15 minutes |
| Monthly check-in | 10 minutes |
| Attending one event together | Event length |
| Total per month | ~1-2 hours |

Mentoring typically lasts 3-6 months, until the newbie feels settled.

## Common Questions

### "What if we don't click?"

That's okay. Not every pairing works. If after two attempts at contact the newbie seems unresponsive, report back to the mentor coordinator. No judgment.

### "What if they ask me something I don't know?"

Say "I don't know, but I can find out" or "Let me connect you with someone who would know." Mentors aren't encyclopedias.

### "What if I'm too busy one month?"

Life happens. Let your mentee know you'll be less available. They'll survive, and you can reconnect when you're able.

### "What if they never show up to events?"

Some people join and don't engage. After a few attempts at contact, let the mentor coordinator know. You did your part.

## System Support

ClubOS tracks mentor engagement through signals:

- When you and your mentee both register for an event
- When you both attend an event
- When you confirm first contact

This helps leadership understand if mentoring is working across the whole program—without surveilling individual relationships.
