# Outside Counsel Sanity Check (Informal)

This memo reflects a 30-minute, issue-spotting review of Murmurant from an intellectual property and licensing perspective.

## Summary Assessment

The project demonstrates a strong, conservative IP posture with low apparent legal risk.

## Key Observations

- Code and documentation appear independently created
- Clean-room development principles are explicitly documented
- No third-party proprietary code or confidential materials are present
- No misuse of third-party trademarks or branding observed
- Governance and enforcement logic is original and well-documented

## Use of AI Tools

Use of AI-assisted drafting tools does not create ownership or licensing claims by the tool provider. Output ownership remains with SBNC.

No attribution or downstream rights obligations are triggered.

## Third-Party Platform Exposure

Experience as a customer of third-party platforms does not create IP restrictions so long as:
- No proprietary source code was copied
- No reverse engineering occurred
- No confidential materials were reused

Based on documentation in this repository, these risks appear well-managed.

## Risk Level

Low, assuming continued adherence to documented IP hygiene practices.

## Recommendations

- Maintain clean-room and IP hygiene documentation
- Avoid competitor-specific language or parity claims
- Revisit this assessment if commercialization or external distribution is contemplated
