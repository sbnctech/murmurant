# Ownership & Intellectual Property Statement

ClubOS is an original software system developed for and owned by the Santa Barbara Newcomers Club (SBNC).

All source code, documentation, architecture, tests, and related materials in this repository were created independently for SBNC and are the property of SBNC, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Development has followed a clean-room methodology. While design decisions are informed by general industry practices and real-world operational experience using third-party platforms, no proprietary source code, internal documentation, non-public APIs, or confidential materials from any third-party system have been used.

Use of AI-assisted tools (e.g., Claude) does not transfer ownership or rights in the resulting work. SBNC retains full ownership and control over this repository and its contents.

This statement is intended to clarify ownership, protect contributors, and support future governance, distribution, or licensing decisions.
