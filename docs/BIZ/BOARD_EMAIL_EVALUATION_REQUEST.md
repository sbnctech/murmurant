# Request for Guarded Authorization to Proceed with ClubOS Evaluation

**From:** Ed Finkler, Outgoing Technology Chair
**To:** SBNC Board of Directors
**Date:** December 2025
**Subject:** Request for Authorization: 30-45 Day ClubOS Evaluation Period

---

Dear Board Members,

I am writing to formally request the Board's authorization to proceed with a guarded evaluation of ClubOS as a potential future platform for SBNC's member and event management needs. This letter explains what I am asking for, what I am not asking for, and the commitments I am prepared to make.

## What This Request Is

This is a request for permission to evaluate. Specifically, I am asking the Board to authorize a 30-45 day period during which:

- A small group of board-nominated participants would review ClubOS functionality
- We would verify that member data can be accurately represented in ClubOS
- We would document what works, what does not work, and what gaps remain
- We would produce a written assessment for Board review at the end of the period

The goal is to answer the question: "Could this work for SBNC?" The answer may be no. That is a valid outcome.

## What This Request Is Not

I want to be explicit about what I am not asking for:

- **This is not a request to replace Wild Apricot today.** Wild Apricot remains our production system. Nothing changes for members, officers, or administrators during this evaluation.

- **This is not a production cutover.** No member-facing services would run on ClubOS during the evaluation period. Wild Apricot continues to be the system of record.

- **This is not a commitment to adopt ClubOS.** The Board retains full authority to decline adoption at the end of the evaluation, or at any point during it.

## Acknowledging Board Concerns

I understand the Board has reasonable concerns about this proposal, and I want to address them directly.

**Wild Apricot is currently safe in the sense of vendor responsibility.** When something breaks in Wild Apricot, we call their support line. We do not have to fix it ourselves. This is a genuine advantage. Moving to any self-managed system means accepting responsibility for things that are currently someone else's problem.

**Continuity is a legitimate concern.** I will not be Technology Chair after this term. If the club adopts ClubOS, someone else will need to maintain it. The Board is right to ask: "What happens when Ed is gone?" I address this in the commitments section below.

**Risk tolerance varies.** Some board members may feel that any risk of disruption outweighs potential benefits. I respect that position. My goal with this evaluation is to reduce uncertainty so the Board can make an informed decision rather than a speculative one.

## Disclosure of Conflicts

I am not a disinterested party in this matter, and the Board should know that.

**I built ClubOS.** I have invested significant personal time in its development. I naturally want to see it succeed.

**I intend to commercialize ClubOS.** My long-term goal is to offer ClubOS as a service to other membership organizations. SBNC would be the first adopter. This means I have a financial interest in SBNC's adoption, even though SBNC itself would pay nothing.

**I am asking you to trust my judgment.** Given these conflicts, the Board may reasonably want additional oversight. I welcome that. The evaluation charter (Exhibit A) includes provisions for board-nominated participants and a structured decision checkpoint.

## Commitments

If the Board authorizes this evaluation, I commit to the following:

**No cost to SBNC.** All infrastructure, development, and support costs during the evaluation period are mine. SBNC pays nothing.

**Full rollback capability.** At any point during or after the evaluation, the Board can decide not to proceed. Wild Apricot remains unchanged. There is no point of no return during this evaluation.

**SBNC retains autonomy.** SBNC's data belongs to SBNC. If the club later decides to stop using ClubOS, all data will be exported in standard formats and deleted from ClubOS systems upon request.

**No proprietary content was exposed.** The ClubOS codebase was developed independently. No Wild Apricot proprietary code, APIs, or licensed content was reverse-engineered or incorporated. Member data used during development was either synthetic or handled in accordance with the data handling principles documented in Exhibit D.

**Documentation of continuity options.** Before the evaluation concludes, I will provide written documentation of what ongoing maintenance would require, including realistic options for the club if I am no longer available to support the system.

## Request for Board Action

I am asking the Board to take the following actions:

1. **Approve the Guarded Evaluation Charter** (Exhibit A), which defines the scope, duration, and constraints of the evaluation period.

2. **Nominate 2-3 board participants** to serve as evaluation reviewers. These individuals would have access to ClubOS during the evaluation, provide feedback, and represent the Board's interests in assessing the system.

3. **Set a decision checkpoint** at the end of the 30-45 day evaluation period. At that checkpoint, the Board would review the evaluation findings and decide whether to:
   - Proceed to a limited pilot (with a separate authorization request)
   - Extend the evaluation period
   - Decline to proceed

## Attached Exhibits

The following exhibits provide additional detail. I have kept this letter focused on the core request; the exhibits contain supporting material for those who want more depth.

- **Exhibit A:** Guarded Evaluation Charter (scope, duration, constraints)
- **Exhibit B:** Technical Architecture Summary
- **Exhibit C:** Data Handling Principles
- **Exhibit D:** Reversibility Guarantee
- **Exhibit E:** Continuity and Maintenance Requirements
- **Exhibit F:** Conflict of Interest Disclosure

## Closing

I recognize that this request asks the Board to trust my judgment on a matter where I have disclosed conflicts of interest. I have tried to structure this proposal so that trust is earned incrementally rather than demanded upfront. The evaluation period is short. The commitments are explicit. The Board retains full authority at every step.

If the Board has questions or concerns I have not addressed, I am happy to discuss them before any vote is taken.

Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully,

Ed Finkler
Outgoing Technology Chair
Santa Barbara Newcomers Club
