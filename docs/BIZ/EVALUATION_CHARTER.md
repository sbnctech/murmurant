# Exhibit A: Murmurant Neutral Evaluation Charter

**Document Classification:** Board Governance
**Evaluation Period:** 30-45 Calendar Days
**Effective Date:** Upon Board Acknowledgment
**Document Version:** 1.0

---

## 1. Purpose of Evaluation

This charter establishes the terms and conditions for a structured, time-bound
evaluation of the Murmurant platform. The purpose is to provide the Board of
Directors and organizational leadership with sufficient information to make
an informed decision regarding potential future consideration of Murmurant.

This evaluation is exploratory in nature. It does not constitute a commitment
to adopt, implement, or endorse the platform. No organizational resources
beyond those explicitly authorized in this charter shall be allocated to
Murmurant-related activities during the evaluation period.

The evaluation seeks to answer one question: Does Murmurant warrant further
consideration as a potential operational platform for this organization?

---

## 2. Scope of Evaluation

The following areas are within scope for this evaluation:

| Area | Evaluation Activities |
|------|----------------------|
| **Functional Capabilities** | Review of documented features against current operational requirements |
| **Data Model** | Assessment of membership, event, and financial data structures |
| **Migration Pathway** | Review of documented migration procedures and reversibility guarantees |
| **Operational Fit** | Comparison with current workflows and volunteer capacity |
| **Documentation Quality** | Assessment of operator guides, training materials, and support resources |
| **Security Posture** | Review of authentication, authorization, and data protection documentation |

Evaluation activities are limited to:

- Reading and reviewing existing documentation
- Observing demonstration environments (read-only)
- Structured interviews with platform maintainers
- Comparison against documented organizational requirements

---

## 3. Explicit Exclusions

The following activities are explicitly excluded from this evaluation:

| Exclusion | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Production data transfer** | No member or financial data shall be migrated or copied |
| **Binding commitments** | No contracts, agreements, or promises shall be made |
| **Staff or volunteer training** | No operational training shall occur during evaluation |
| **Public announcements** | No external communication regarding the evaluation |
| **Resource allocation** | No budget allocation beyond evaluation costs |
| **Timeline commitments** | No adoption dates or implementation schedules |
| **Vendor negotiations** | No pricing, licensing, or service-level discussions |

This evaluation does not authorize any party to represent that the organization
has adopted, endorsed, or committed to Murmurant. Any such representation is
unauthorized and does not bind the organization.

---

## 4. Success Criteria

The evaluation shall be deemed successful if all of the following conditions
are met by the conclusion of the evaluation period:

### 4.1 Required Deliverables

| Deliverable | Acceptance Criteria |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Capabilities Assessment | Written comparison of Murmurant features against 10 prioritized organizational requirements |
| Risk Assessment | Documented identification of material risks with proposed mitigations |
| Migration Analysis | Written summary of data migration requirements, timeline estimates, and reversibility provisions |
| Resource Estimate | Preliminary estimate of volunteer hours, training needs, and transition costs |
| Recommendation Memo | Board-ready summary with one of three recommendations: Proceed, Decline, or Defer |

### 4.2 Process Requirements

- All evaluation sessions documented with date, participants, and summary
- No unresolved blocking questions regarding data security or member privacy
- At least two independent reviewers concur on findings
- Evaluation completed within the authorized time period

Success does not imply endorsement. A successful evaluation produces the
information necessary for an informed decision; it does not predetermine
what that decision shall be.

---

## 5. Failure Criteria and Abort Conditions

The evaluation shall be terminated immediately if any of the following
conditions occur:

### 5.1 Mandatory Abort Conditions

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **Data security concern** | Any indication that member data could be exposed or compromised |
| **Unauthorized commitment** | Any party makes binding promises on behalf of the organization |
| **Resource overrun** | Evaluation activities exceed authorized time or cost thresholds |
| **Scope expansion** | Evaluation activities extend beyond those authorized in this charter |
| **Board directive** | The Board directs termination for any reason |

### 5.2 Discretionary Abort Conditions

The Evaluation Lead may recommend termination if:

- Fundamental incompatibility with organizational requirements is identified
- Documentation is insufficient to complete required assessments
- Platform maintainers are unresponsive to reasonable inquiries
- Evaluation cannot be completed within the authorized period

Termination of the evaluation does not reflect negatively on any party. It
indicates only that the conditions for a productive evaluation were not met
at this time.
