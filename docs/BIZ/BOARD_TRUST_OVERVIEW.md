## What Problem Murmurant Solves

Your organization runs on Wild Apricot today. Wild Apricot stores your member records, event history, and registration data. It works, but it may not fit your needs going forward.

Murmurant is a membership management system designed for clubs like yours. Moving from Wild Apricot to Murmurant means transferring your organization's data and operations to a new home.

This transfer is called **migration**. It is the most consequential thing we will do together.

## Why Migrations Are Dangerous

Migrations fail. They fail for organizations of all sizes, with vendors of all reputations. The failures share common patterns:

| What Goes Wrong | What It Means |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Data gets lost | Member records disappear or arrive incomplete |
| Data gets corrupted | Information arrives but is wrong—names, dates, relationships |
| Operations stop | The old system is gone, the new system is not ready |
| No way back | Problems discovered after the switch cannot be undone |

These failures cause real harm. Members cannot log in. Event history vanishes. Renewals break. The organization loses credibility with its membership.

**We take this seriously.** The process described below exists because these failures are common, not because they are rare.

## How Murmurant Reduces Risk

We reduce risk through structure, not promises. The migration process has four deliberate constraints:

### 1. You See Before You Commit

Before any real change occurs, you see exactly what would happen. This is called a **preview**. The preview shows:

- How many members would transfer
- How data would be organized
- What warnings or problems exist

Nothing happens until you review the preview and say "proceed."

### 2. You Can Practice Without Consequence

Before the real migration, you can run a **rehearsal**. A rehearsal is a complete practice run. It uses your real data but does not affect your live systems.

After rehearsal, you can:

- Inspect the results
- Find problems
- Fix them
- Rehearse again

You can rehearse as many times as you need. There is no limit.

### 3. Your Source System Stays Untouched

During the entire migration process, Wild Apricot remains unchanged. We read from it. We do not write to it. We do not delete from it.

If anything goes wrong—at any point before the final switch—your Wild Apricot data is exactly where you left it.

### 4. You Must Explicitly Authorize the Switch

The final switch to Murmurant (called **cutover**) requires your explicit authorization. It does not happen automatically. It does not happen on a timer. It does not happen because a deadline passed.

You say when. You say if.

---

## What Controls You Retain

Throughout the process, you control:

| Control | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| **Timing** | No phase proceeds until you authorize it |
| **Pace** | Take as long as you need between phases |
| **Abort** | Stop the process at any point before cutover |
| **Review** | See what will happen before it happens |
| **Sign-off** | Nothing consequential occurs without your explicit approval |

The system proposes. You decide.

## What Murmurant Explicitly Does Not Do

We want to be clear about our limits:

### We Do Not Promise Perfection

Migrations surface data quality issues that existed before we arrived. Some member records may have missing information. Some historical data may be inconsistent. We will show you what we find. We cannot fix what was never correct.

### We Do Not Automate Consequential Decisions

Every decision that affects your organization requires a human to approve it. We do not automate cutover. We do not automate publishing. We do not make choices for you.

### We Do Not Guarantee Rollback After Cutover

Before cutover, you can abort with no consequences. After cutover, going back is harder. Recovery procedures exist, and we have documented them, but reversing a completed migration is a significant operation—not a button press.

### We Do Not Hide Problems

If something looks wrong, we tell you. If a preview shows warnings, you see them. We do not proceed hoping you will not notice. Honest communication is part of the process.

## What Decisions the Board Must Make

Migration involves decisions that belong to your leadership, not to us:

### Before Migration Begins

- **Authorize proceeding** — Should the organization pursue this migration?
- **Designate a coordinator** — Who will work with Murmurant staff during the process?
- **Set expectations** — What does success look like for your organization?

### During Migration

- **Approve policy mappings** — How should your membership rules translate to Murmurant?
- **Review rehearsal results** — Does the practice run meet your expectations?
- **Decide timing** — When is the right moment to switch?

### At Cutover

- **Authorize the switch** — This is the point of no easy return. Are you ready?
- **Communicate to members** — How will you announce the change?

### After Migration

- **Confirm satisfaction** — Did the migration meet your expectations?
- **Report issues** — What needs adjustment?

These decisions are yours. We provide information and guidance. You provide judgment and authorization.

## Summary

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Preview before action** | You see what will happen before it happens |
| **Rehearsal without risk** | You can practice the full migration safely |
| **Source system protected** | Wild Apricot stays untouched until you switch |
| **Explicit authorization** | Nothing consequential happens without your approval |
| **Honest communication** | We show problems, not hide them |
| **Your pace, your timing** | No artificial deadlines or pressure |

We earn trust through restraint, not promises. The process is structured to make mistakes recoverable and decisions reversible—because migrations are serious, and your organization's data matters.

## Questions

If you have questions about this process, please ask. Board-level understanding is not optional—it is part of how we work.
