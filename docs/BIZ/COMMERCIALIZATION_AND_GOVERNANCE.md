# Commercialization and Governance Guardrails

This document defines the ethical, legal, and governance boundaries for Murmurant
commercialization, with Santa Barbara Newcomers Club (SBNC) serving as Client
Zero. It is intended for board review, legal counsel, and organizational
leadership.

## Purpose

Establish clear boundaries that:

- Protect SBNC's organizational independence
- Define the nature of the Client Zero relationship
- Prevent conflicts of interest
- Ensure evaluation remains separate from adoption decisions

## Definitions

### Client Zero

A **Client Zero** is an initial deployment partner whose operational use
informs product development. The relationship is characterized by:

- Early access to capabilities in development
- Feedback that influences product direction
- Acceptance of higher operational uncertainty
- No obligation to continue use beyond evaluation

Client Zero status does not imply:

- Endorsement of the product for other organizations
- Commitment to long-term adoption
- Reduced governance standards
- Waiver of the organization's independent decision-making

### Commercialization

For this document, **commercialization** refers to any activity that:

- Offers Murmurant capabilities to organizations other than SBNC
- Generates revenue from licensing, hosting, or services
- Creates intellectual property with potential market value
- Establishes business relationships based on Murmurant technology

## Governance Principles

### G1: Organizational Independence

SBNC retains full independence in all operational and governance decisions.

- The board maintains sole authority over technology adoption
- No external party may direct SBNC's use of Murmurant
- Evaluation participation does not bind future decisions
- SBNC may discontinue use at any time for any reason

### G2: Evaluation Does Not Obligate Adoption

Participation as Client Zero is explicitly an evaluation activity.

- Evaluation may conclude with a decision not to adopt
- No contractual, financial, or social pressure shall influence adoption
- The board may request independent technical review
- Negative evaluation findings shall be documented without prejudice

### G3: No Operational Dependency Without Approval

SBNC shall not become operationally dependent on Murmurant without explicit
board approval.

- Critical operations must have documented fallback procedures
- Data must remain exportable in standard formats
- Migration paths to alternative systems must be maintained
- Dependency on specific vendors or individuals must be disclosed

### G4: Transparency in Dual Roles

Any individual serving both SBNC and Murmurant commercialization interests
must disclose this relationship.

- Conflicts of interest shall be declared to the board
- Affected individuals shall recuse from relevant decisions
- Financial interests shall be documented
- Decision-making authority shall rest with unconflicted parties

## Commercial Boundaries

### Royalty Participation Rationale

If SBNC contributes to Murmurant value through:

- Operational feedback that improves the product
- Domain expertise incorporated into features
- Testing that validates commercial readiness
- Documentation that benefits other organizations

Then SBNC may receive consideration proportional to that contribution. Any
such arrangement requires:

- Board approval of terms
- Independent valuation of contribution
- Written agreement reviewed by legal counsel
- Disclosure to membership as appropriate

### Non-Exclusivity

SBNC's participation as Client Zero:

- Does not grant Murmurant exclusive rights to SBNC's operational data
- Does not prevent SBNC from using competing products
- Does not obligate SBNC to provide ongoing feedback or support
- Does not restrict SBNC from sharing evaluation findings

Murmurant commercialization:

- May serve other organizations without SBNC approval
- May incorporate learnings from SBNC deployment
- Must not disclose SBNC-specific data without permission
- Must not represent SBNC endorsement without written consent

### Exit Rights

SBNC may exit the Client Zero relationship at any time.

**Data Rights on Exit:**

- All SBNC data remains SBNC property
- Export in standard formats shall be provided within 30 days
- No data shall be retained after exit without written consent
- Historical backups shall be destroyed upon request

**Operational Continuity:**

- 90-day transition period for migration planning
- Documentation of current state shall be provided
- No degradation of service during transition period
- Technical support for data export shall be provided

**No Penalty Provisions:**

- Exit shall not trigger financial penalties
- Exit shall not affect unrelated organizational relationships
- Exit shall not result in negative public statements
- Exit decision requires no justification to external parties

## Evaluation Framework

### Separation of Evaluation and Endorsement

Evaluation activities generate findings. Findings are not endorsements.

| Activity | Output | Interpretation |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| Feature testing | Bug reports, usability notes | Technical feedback |
| Operational use | Performance data, incidents | Operational learning |
| User feedback | Surveys, interviews | User experience data |
| Board review | Decision documentation | Governance record |

None of these outputs constitute endorsement for external use.

### Documentation Requirements

All evaluation activities shall produce documented findings.

- Findings shall be factual and specific
- Findings shall distinguish observation from interpretation
- Findings shall note confidence level and data quality
- Findings shall be available to the board upon request

### Decision Authority

| Decision | Authority | Required Input |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Continue evaluation | Operations committee | Technical findings |
| Expand scope | Board | Risk assessment |
| Adopt for production | Board | Independent review |
| Exit evaluation | Board or Operations | Exit plan |
| Approve royalty terms | Board | Legal review |

## Prohibited Activities

The following activities are prohibited without explicit board approval:

- Representing SBNC endorsement in marketing materials
- Sharing SBNC member data with third parties
- Creating operational dependencies on non-approved systems
- Entering financial agreements on SBNC's behalf
- Making public statements about SBNC's use of Murmurant

## Review and Amendment

This document shall be reviewed:

- Annually by the board
- Upon any change to the Client Zero relationship
- Upon any commercialization activity affecting SBNC
- Upon request by any board member

Amendments require board approval and shall be documented with effective
dates.

## Acknowledgment

This document establishes governance boundaries. It does not constitute:

- A contract between parties
- Legal advice
- Endorsement of any commercial arrangement
- Waiver of any organizational rights

Organizations considering similar arrangements should seek independent
legal and governance counsel.
