# Board Narrative: For a Cautious-but-Curious Board

**Audience**: Board members who are open to change but want to understand the practical realities before committing.

**Tone**: Practical conversation between colleagues, not a sales pitch.

---

## What This Is Actually About

We pay Wild Apricot about $1,500 a year to manage our membership and events. It works, but it has friction points that volunteers complain about. Ed built something called ClubOS that might work better for us. He has a financial interest in its success, which creates a conflict of interest that he is disclosing upfront.

We are being asked to spend 30-45 days testing whether ClubOS actually works for our needs. This is not a vote to switch. It is a vote to gather information.

---

## What We Would Be Testing

During the evaluation, volunteer testers would try out ClubOS in a test environment:

- Can we add and renew members?
- Can we set up events and take registrations?
- Can we send emails that actually arrive?
- Can we process payments?
- Is it easier or harder than Wild Apricot?

We would document what works, what does not, and what is missing. At the end, the board would have a report with evidence, not opinions.

---

## What Changes If We Adopt (Later)

If the evaluation goes well and we decide to adopt:

| Today (Wild Apricot) | After (ClubOS) |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Pay annual platform fee | No platform fee |
| Email bundled but limited | Pay for email service directly |
| Wild Apricot handles payments | We choose a payment processor |
| Vendor support | Ed plus volunteer knowledge |

The money savings from no platform fee would offset some new costs (email service, potentially different payment rates). A real cost comparison would be part of the evaluation.

---

## What Stays the Same

- Member data stays ours (both systems allow export)
- Events, registrations, payments work the same way conceptually
- Volunteers still do the same jobs
- Board still makes governance decisions

ClubOS is a different tool for the same work. It does not change what we do; it changes how the software supports what we do.

---

## The Conflict of Interest, Plainly Stated

Ed built ClubOS. If we use it and it becomes a commercial product, Ed benefits financially. He is not hiding this.

The safeguard is that Ed does not run the evaluation or vote on the decision. Someone else leads the testing, someone else writes the report, and the board decides without his vote. If you think the safeguards are not sufficient, you can vote no on the evaluation.

---

## What Could Go Wrong During the Evaluation

**Evaluation risks (low stakes):**

- The test system could have bugs. This does not affect our real operations.
- Volunteers might find it confusing. That is valuable information.
- We might discover ClubOS cannot do something we need. Also valuable.

The evaluation is designed to surface problems in a safe environment. Finding problems is success, not failure.

---

## What Could Go Wrong If We Adopt

**Adoption risks (higher stakes):**

- ClubOS might have bugs that affect real operations. Mitigation: We would run both systems in parallel during transition.
- Ed might become unavailable (illness, burnout, other priorities). Mitigation: The code is documented and exportable. Another developer could take over, though finding one takes effort.
- We might regret switching. Mitigation: Data can be exported. We could return to Wild Apricot or try something else. The sunk cost would be the transition effort.

None of these risks are zero. The question is whether they are acceptable given the potential benefits.

---

## What Could Go Wrong If We Stay With Wild Apricot

**Status quo risks:**

- Wild Apricot could raise prices. They have done this before.
- Wild Apricot could change features in ways we dislike. We would have to adapt.
- The workarounds we use (email forwarding, manual processes) continue indefinitely.

Staying with Wild Apricot is not risk-free. It is a different set of risks.

---

## The 30-45 Day Timeline

| Week | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| 1 | Set up test environment, brief testers |
| 2-3 | Test core features (members, events, payments) |
| 4-5 | Test end-to-end workflows, gather feedback |
| 6 | Write report, present findings to board |

At any point, the evaluation can be stopped. Starting does not require finishing.

---

## What "Yes" and "No" Mean Right Now

**Voting yes on the evaluation means:**

- You authorize spending volunteer time to test ClubOS
- You want more information before making a decision
- You are curious but not committed

**Voting no on the evaluation means:**

- You prefer to continue with Wild Apricot
- You do not think the potential benefits justify the evaluation effort
- You are not comfortable with the conflict of interest safeguards

Both are reasonable positions. The board should decide what is right for the organization.

---

## Questions to Ask Yourself

1. Are we satisfied enough with Wild Apricot that exploring alternatives is not worth the effort?

2. Do we trust the evaluation process to give us honest information despite Ed's involvement?

3. Do we have volunteers willing to spend time testing during the evaluation period?

4. Is this the right time, given other things the organization has going on?

If the answer to any of these is "no," that is a legitimate reason to decline or defer.

---

## What the Board Is Not Deciding Today

- Whether to switch to ClubOS (that comes after the evaluation)
- Whether ClubOS is better than Wild Apricot (that is what we would test)
- How to handle any commercial relationship with ClubOS, Inc. (separate discussion)
- Whether Ed has done anything wrong (he has not; he is disclosing a conflict)

Today is about whether to gather information. The bigger decisions come later.

---

## A Note on Tone

This document is written differently than the formal exhibits. Those are thorough and documented. This is a conversation.

If you prefer the formal versions, use those. If you find this version helpful for thinking through the decision, use this. Both say the same things; this one just says them more casually.

---

## Summary

We have a system that works adequately. We have an alternative that might work better, built by someone with a conflict of interest who is being transparent about it. We are being asked to test the alternative in a low-risk way before making any commitment.

The evaluation is not free (it costs volunteer time). But the information it produces would help us make a better decision than we can make today.

That is the practical reality. The board should decide whether it is worth pursuing.
