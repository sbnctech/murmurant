# Exhibit C: Dual Business Model — SBNC and ClubOS, Inc.

```
Audience: Board Members, Finance Committees, Presidents, Legal Counsel
Purpose: Explain the business model from both client and company perspectives
Classification: Strategic Planning Document
```

## Executive Summary

ClubOS operates as a dual-entity model: ClubOS, Inc. (a commercial software company) provides technology to nonprofit organizations like the Santa Barbara Newcomers Club (SBNC). This document explains why this arrangement creates value for both parties, why the incentives align, and why SBNC's role as the founding client ("Client Zero") is both appropriate and protected.

The core proposition is straightforward: SBNC gets better technology at lower cost with reduced volunteer burden, while ClubOS, Inc. gets a committed development partner and a pathway to serving the broader nonprofit market.

## Part 1: The SBNC Perspective

### 1.1 Current State: Wild Apricot Costs and Limitations

SBNC currently operates on Wild Apricot, a third-party platform. While functional, this arrangement has known costs and constraints:

**Direct Costs:**

| Item | Estimated Annual Cost |
|------|----------------------|
| Wild Apricot subscription | $1,800 - $3,600 |
| Supplemental email services | $500 - $1,200 |
| Third-party form tools | $200 - $600 |
| Payment processing fees | Variable |
| **Total Platform Costs** | **$2,500 - $5,400+** |

**Indirect Costs (Volunteer Time):**

- Workarounds for permission limitations
- Manual data reconciliation between systems
- Training new volunteers on multiple platforms
- Debugging integration failures

These indirect costs are difficult to quantify but represent real volunteer burden.

### 1.2 What SBNC Gains from ClubOS

**Cost Reduction:**

ClubOS consolidates multiple paid services into a single platform:

- Membership management (replaces Wild Apricot core)
- Email communications (replaces supplemental services)
- Event registration and payments
- Role-based permissions (eliminates workaround complexity)
- Website and content management

The licensing model (see Section 2.2) is designed to be competitive with or below current Wild Apricot costs for an organization of SBNC's size.

**Elimination of Duplicated Infrastructure:**

Wild Apricot forces nonprofits to maintain parallel systems:

| Function | Wild Apricot Approach | ClubOS Approach |
|----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Permissions | Limited roles; manual workarounds | Fine-grained, delegated roles |
| Email | Basic; often supplemented | Integrated with membership |
| Event capacity | Per-event configuration | Policy-driven, auditable |
| Member data | Export/import workflows | Single source of truth |

ClubOS eliminates the "duct tape" integrations that consume volunteer time.

**Volunteer Load Reduction:**

The most significant benefit is reduced volunteer burden:

- **Fewer systems to learn:** One platform instead of three or four
- **Delegated administration:** Activity chairs manage their own events without IT help
- **Automated workflows:** Registration opens, waitlist promotions, and announcements follow configured rules
- **Self-service:** Members update their own profiles, reducing data-entry work

This matters because volunteer capacity is SBNC's scarcest resource. Every hour spent on system administration is an hour not spent on member engagement.

**Risk Distribution:**

With Wild Apricot, SBNC bears platform risk alone:

- If Wild Apricot raises prices, SBNC pays or migrates
- If Wild Apricot discontinues features, SBNC adapts or loses capability
- If Wild Apricot has outages, SBNC waits

With ClubOS:

- SBNC has input into development priorities
- The codebase is not controlled by a distant vendor
- Multiple organizations share development costs
- SBNC's operational needs drive product direction

**Governance Protection:**

ClubOS is designed around nonprofit governance needs:

- Audit trails for board accountability
- Role transitions that match term limits
- Financial reporting aligned to nonprofit accounting
- Transparent rules (no hidden automation)

These are not afterthoughts; they are architectural requirements. Wild Apricot was not designed for this level of governance transparency.

### 1.3 What SBNC Gives Up

Transparency requires acknowledging trade-offs:

**Vendor Maturity:**

Wild Apricot is a mature, established vendor. ClubOS is newer. This means:

- Some features may be less polished initially
- Documentation is still developing
- Edge cases may surface during early use

**Migration Effort:**

Transitioning from Wild Apricot requires effort:

- Data migration (though assisted by tooling)
- Volunteer retraining
- Process adjustment

This is a one-time cost, but it is real.

**Relationship Complexity:**

Being Client Zero means a closer relationship with the technology provider. This is mostly an advantage, but it requires:

- Occasional feedback sessions
- Patience during development
- Clear communication about priorities

## Part 2: The ClubOS, Inc. Perspective

### 2.1 The Nonprofit Market Opportunity

Nonprofit organizations represent an underserved market for operations software:

**Market Characteristics:**

- Thousands of membership-based nonprofits in the US alone
- Most use fragmented tools (Wild Apricot, spreadsheets, email lists)
- Price-sensitive but willing to pay for reduced volunteer burden
- High loyalty once operational dependency is established
- Word-of-mouth is the primary acquisition channel

**Why Nonprofits Are a Coherent Market:**

Despite surface differences, membership nonprofits share common operational patterns:

- Membership lifecycles (join, renew, lapse)
- Event management with capacity constraints
- Volunteer coordination and role transitions
- Financial stewardship and transparency requirements
- Communication workflows (newsletters, announcements)

A platform that solves these well for one organization can serve many.

### 2.2 Revenue Model

ClubOS, Inc. generates revenue through two primary mechanisms:

**Licensing (Per Engaged User):**

Organizations pay based on active membership:

| Tier | Monthly Rate | Example (500 members) |
|------|--------------|----------------------|
| Base | $X per engaged user | $150 - $300/month |

"Engaged user" is defined as members who have logged in or participated in the billing period. This aligns cost with value received—organizations with dormant members do not pay for unused capacity.

**Transaction Fees:**

Event registrations and payments include a small transaction fee:

| Transaction Type | Fee Structure |
|------------------|---------------|
| Paid registration | Percentage + fixed |
| Free registration | Minimal or zero |
| Donations | Percentage |

Transaction fees align ClubOS revenue with organizational activity. When organizations thrive (more events, more registrations), ClubOS revenue grows proportionally.

### 2.3 Why This Scales Without Staff Explosion

Software businesses scale differently than service businesses:

**Marginal Cost of Additional Customers:**

Once the platform is built, adding a new organization requires:

- Onboarding support (one-time)
- Infrastructure scaling (minimal per customer)
- Ongoing support (mostly self-service)

Unlike consulting or professional services, each new customer does not require proportional staff growth.

**Automation of Support:**

ClubOS is designed for self-service operation:

- Organizations configure their own policies
- Documentation is comprehensive
- Support is primarily handled through async channels
- The platform surfaces errors clearly (reducing support tickets)

**Shared Development Costs:**

Features built for one organization benefit all. When SBNC needs better event management, that improvement serves every ClubOS customer. Development costs are amortized across the customer base.

### 2.4 Why Incentives Align with Customer Outcomes

The revenue model creates alignment:

**Engaged User Pricing:**

- ClubOS earns more when organizations have more active members
- This incentivizes features that increase member engagement
- Organizations do not pay for value they do not receive

**Transaction Fees:**

- ClubOS earns more when organizations run successful events
- This incentivizes features that make events easier to manage
- Failed events (cancellations, no-shows) reduce ClubOS revenue too

**Long-Term Relationships:**

- Switching costs are high (migration effort)
- This incentivizes ClubOS to maintain customer satisfaction
- Unhappy customers do not renew; the model punishes short-term thinking

**Contrast with Wild Apricot:**

Wild Apricot's pricing is based on total contacts, not engagement. Organizations pay the same whether members are active or dormant. This creates no incentive for Wild Apricot to help organizations improve engagement.

## Part 3: SBNC as Client Zero

### 3.1 What "Client Zero" Means

SBNC is the founding customer of ClubOS. This means:

- ClubOS was initially developed to solve SBNC's specific problems
- SBNC's operational patterns informed the architecture
- SBNC has influence on development priorities
- SBNC's success is proof-of-concept for the broader market

### 3.2 Why SBNC Is Uniquely Positioned

**Operational Sophistication:**

SBNC is not a simple organization:

- 500+ active members
- Multiple activity committees with delegated leadership
- Complex event calendar (dozens of events monthly)
- Formal governance (board, bylaws, term limits)
- Financial controls and reporting requirements

If ClubOS works for SBNC, it can work for most membership nonprofits.

**Access to Real Problems:**

The ClubOS development team has direct access to:

- SBNC's actual workflows (not theoretical use cases)
- SBNC's volunteers and their pain points
- SBNC's historical data for testing
- SBNC's board for governance validation

This access is invaluable. Most software companies guess at customer needs; ClubOS can observe them directly.

**Willingness to Iterate:**

SBNC has accepted the role of development partner:

- Providing feedback on features
- Tolerating some early-stage roughness
- Prioritizing operational needs over polish
- Serving as reference customer for future clients

### 3.3 Why Royalty Participation Is Reasonable

SBNC's contribution to ClubOS development justifies participation in commercial success:

**What SBNC Contributed:**

- Requirements definition (hundreds of hours of operational insight)
- Testing and validation (real-world usage, bug reports)
- Reference case (credibility for future sales)
- Patience (accepting early-stage limitations)

**What Royalty Participation Provides:**

- Ongoing revenue share from ClubOS commercial success
- Alignment between SBNC's investment and ClubOS's growth
- Potential offset to future licensing costs
- Recognition of founding-customer contribution

**Reasonable Structure:**

Royalty participation should be:

- Capped (not unlimited liability to ClubOS)
- Time-limited (not perpetual)
- Based on net revenue (not gross, to account for costs)
- Clearly documented (auditable by both parties)

This is standard practice for founding customers in software development.

### 3.4 Why This Does Not Expose SBNC to Liability

SBNC's role is customer, not owner:

**SBNC Does Not:**

- Own ClubOS, Inc. equity
- Control ClubOS, Inc. operations
- Guarantee ClubOS, Inc. obligations
- Assume liability for ClubOS, Inc. products

**SBNC's Relationship Is:**

- Licensing agreement (customer pays for service)
- Royalty agreement (customer receives share of revenue)
- Advisory relationship (customer provides feedback)

**Legal Separation:**

ClubOS, Inc. is a separate legal entity. SBNC's nonprofit status is not affected by:

- ClubOS, Inc. commercial activities
- ClubOS, Inc. relationships with other customers
- ClubOS, Inc. success or failure

SBNC should confirm this separation with legal counsel, but the structure is designed to maintain clear boundaries.

**Royalty Income Treatment:**

Royalty income to SBNC may be treated as:

- Passive investment income (similar to interest or dividends)
- Not unrelated business income (depending on structure)

SBNC should consult with its accountant on tax treatment, but royalties from intellectual property-adjacent arrangements are common for nonprofits.
