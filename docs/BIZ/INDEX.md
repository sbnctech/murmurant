# ClubOS Business Model Documentation

This folder contains the canonical business model documentation for ClubOS,
synthesized from design discussions and strategic planning sessions.

---

## Purpose

ChatGPT serves as a design studio for exploring business model concepts.
This repo serves as durable memory. Documents here represent curated,
board- and operator-readable synthesis of those discussions.

---

## Canonical Documents

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [BUSINESS_MODEL_CANONICAL.md](./BUSINESS_MODEL_CANONICAL.md) | One-page overview of value proposition and commercialization |
| [MIGRATION_PHILOSOPHY.md](./MIGRATION_PHILOSOPHY.md) | The staged "wing-walking" migration approach |
| [NON_GOALS_AND_EXCLUSIONS.md](./NON_GOALS_AND_EXCLUSIONS.md) | What we explicitly do NOT do for v1 |
| [DECISIONS_LEDGER.md](./DECISIONS_LEDGER.md) | Dated log of key business and product decisions |

## ChatGPT Design Studio Archive

ChatGPT served as a design studio for exploring business model concepts.
The reasoning from those sessions is preserved in two forms:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [CHATGPT_REASONING_INDEX.md](./CHATGPT_REASONING_INDEX.md) | Curated navigation guide - read this first |
| [_ARCHIVE/CHATGPT_TRANSCRIPTS/](./_ARCHIVE/CHATGPT_TRANSCRIPTS/) | Verbatim transcript archive |

The transcript is the authoritative primary source. The index provides
navigation and brief summaries. Neither is binding - the canonical docs
in this folder are the actual rules.

### Key Archive Files

- [CHATGPT_BUSINESS_MODEL_TRANSCRIPT_2025-12-24.md](./_ARCHIVE/CHATGPT_TRANSCRIPTS/CHATGPT_BUSINESS_MODEL_TRANSCRIPT_2025-12-24.md) -
  Full design studio reasoning on business model, migration philosophy,
  sync exclusions, and commercialization

---

## How Updates Happen

1. Strategic discussion happens in ChatGPT (design studio)
2. Key excerpts are pasted verbatim into transcript archive files
3. Claude Code synthesizes curated docs from those transcripts
4. PR is opened for review and merge
5. Canonical docs become the authoritative reference

This workflow preserves both the raw thinking (transcripts) and the
refined conclusions (canonical docs).
