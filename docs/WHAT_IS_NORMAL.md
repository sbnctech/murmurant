# What Is Normal (SBNC + ClubOS)
A short guide for leaders and volunteers

## Why this exists
Leaders and volunteers often hesitate because:
- Not knowing what is "normal"
- Fear of breaking something
- Not knowing what the system will and will not do

This document defines "normal" operating patterns so people can act confidently.

## What is normal for members
- New members may be shy or unsure. It is normal to attend alone.
- New members may not know which event is right. It is normal to ask for help.
- It is normal for members to try 1-2 events before finding their people.

## What is normal for events
- Some events fill quickly. Some do not.
- It is normal for an event to be undersubscribed sometimes.
- It is normal for an event to run a surplus or a loss on its own.
- The term-level goal is event neutrality (committee and club): neither makes nor loses money from events over the term.

## What is normal for mentorship
- Mentorship is a low-risk volunteer role.
- "Mentor completion" means: the mentor agrees to be a mentor and receives an assignment.
- No other completion criteria are required.
- It is normal for some pairs to be more active than others.

Signals that should be normal in the system:
- VP Membership can see unmatched newbies and available mentors.
- Matching is immediate (no end-of-term batching).
- When a match is made, both parties are notified.
- Mentorship should appear in the member's activity history for third-year decisions.

## What is normal for leadership transitions
- Some tasks will be unfamiliar to new leaders.
- It is normal to use checklists and guardrails.
- It is normal to review action logs when something feels uncertain.

## What is not normal (red flags)

- Silent failures where actions appear to succeed but nothing changes
- Repeated manual work to fix the same issue without root cause review
- Leaders avoiding actions due to fear of breaking the system
- Missing or inconsistent signals (status, roles, permissions)
- No audit trail for decisions that affect members
- Emergency access or workarounds becoming routine
- New members cannot find any viable events soon after joining.
- Newbie reserved tickets are not released at the right time.
- Signals do not flow through registration/email/events (status badges missing).
- Volunteer load concentrates on a few people.
- Third-year membership grows faster than volunteer capacity.

## How ClubOS should help
- Provide "what happens next" guidance at the moment it matters.
- Provide safe modes, previews, and reversibility when appropriate.
- Provide action logs that make leadership decisions auditable and calm.
