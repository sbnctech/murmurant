## Package Overview

The Readiness Engagement produces implementation-ready artifacts before
migration begins. Fixed scope. Fixed price. Concrete deliverables.

This is a gate, not a promise. It ends with a Go/No-Go decision.

## Hard Stops and Pause Protocol

The engagement pauses or terminates if:

- No named decision-maker identified after Week 1
- Data export not provided by Week 2
- Unresolved governance conflicts block data mapping
- Client requests bylaws rewrite or board restructuring

Pause does not extend timeline without scope amendment.
Terminated engagements retain completed deliverables; no refund for work done.

See: [Scope Boundaries and Non-Goals](./SCOPE_BOUNDARIES_AND_NON_GOALS.md)

- Conflict resolution between stakeholders
