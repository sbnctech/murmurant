# Readiness + Migration Blueprint

Copyright (c) Santa Barbara Newcomers Club
Status: Internal Product Definition
Audience: Board, Operations, Sales

## What It Is

A time-boxed, priced engagement that produces implementation-ready
artifacts before any migration begins. Not consulting. Not advice.
Concrete deliverables with clear acceptance criteria.

The Blueprint is a gate, not a promise. It ends with a Go/No-Go
decision based on validated data and explicit risk acceptance.

**Duration:** 2-6 weeks depending on tier and organization complexity.

---

## Who It Is For

**Good Fit:**
- Organizations migrating from Wild Apricot or similar platforms
- Clubs with 100-5000 members and defined governance structure
- Organizations with at least one accountable operator (paid or volunteer)
- Boards willing to make decisions before implementation begins

**Not a Fit:**
- Organizations still deciding whether to use membership software
- Clubs without defined membership categories or governance
- Organizations expecting vendor to resolve internal disputes
- Situations where no one has authority to approve data mapping

**Red Flag:** If the organization cannot name who will approve the
final deliverables, the engagement should not start.

## Inputs Required

The following must be provided before the engagement begins:

| Input | Source | Required By |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Completed Readiness Self-Assessment | Client | Day 0 |
| Data export from current system | Client | Week 1 |
| Current bylaws and policies (PDF) | Client | Week 1 |
| Membership level definitions | Client | Week 1 |
| Sample event registrations (3-5) | Client | Week 1 |
| Named decision-maker for approvals | Client | Day 0 |
| Access to current admin for Q&A | Client | Ongoing |

See: `READINESS_ASSESSMENT_CHECKLIST.md` and `INTAKE_SCHEMA.md`

---

## Deliverables

Every engagement produces these explicit artifacts:

### 1. Completed Intake Bundle (Validated)

- Intake schema populated with verified data
- Data quality report (completeness, consistency, anomalies)
- Source system inventory with field mappings
- Known data gaps documented

### 2. Data Mapping + Normalization Plan

- Field-by-field mapping from source to ClubOS schema
- Normalization rules for names, addresses, dates
- Duplicate detection strategy
- Historical data retention decisions

### 3. Roles and Capabilities Proposal

- Proposed role structure mapped to ClubOS permission model
- Current vs. proposed access comparison
- Escalation paths defined
- Admin succession plan outline

### 4. Content/Publishing Inventory

- Current pages/content cataloged
- Audience mapping (public, member, admin)
- Migration priority ranking
- Content requiring rewrite vs. direct migration

### 5. Implementation Plan + Go/No-Go

- Phased implementation timeline
- Dependency map (what blocks what)
- Resource requirements (client and vendor)
- Explicit Go/No-Go criteria
- Rollback plan if migration fails

### 6. Risk Acceptance Register Entries

- Identified risks with severity rating
- Required decisions before proceeding
- Risks client must explicitly accept
- Risks that block Go decision until resolved

## What Causes Timeline/Price Adjustments

The following factors increase engagement scope:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Data export delays (client-side) | Timeline extension |
| Data quality issues requiring cleanup | Additional normalization work |
| Missing or conflicting policies | Decision memo required |
| Multiple approval stakeholders | Extended review cycles |
| Custom membership logic | Additional mapping work |
| Historical data beyond 3 years | Additional migration planning |
| Content volume > 50 pages | Additional inventory work |
| Integration requirements | Out of scope (separate engagement) |

**Hard Stop Triggers:**
- No named decision-maker after Week 1
- Data export not provided by Week 2
- Unresolved governance conflicts blocking data mapping
- Client requests bylaws rewrite or board restructuring

---

## Explicit Non-Goals

This engagement does NOT include:

- **Governance consulting.** We do not advise on board structure,
  committee organization, or leadership succession.

- **Bylaws rewriting.** We do not draft, edit, or interpret bylaws
  beyond what is required for system configuration.

- **Conflict resolution.** We do not mediate disputes between
  stakeholders about how the organization should operate.

- **General management advice.** We do not advise on fundraising,
  marketing, event strategy, or volunteer management.

- **Legal advice.** We do not interpret legal requirements or
  provide compliance guidance beyond system capabilities.

- **Ongoing support.** This engagement ends with deliverables.
  Ongoing support is a separate relationship.

## Engagement Completion Criteria

The Blueprint engagement is complete when:

1. All deliverables are provided in final form
2. Client has reviewed and acknowledged each artifact
3. Go/No-Go decision is documented
4. Risk acceptance register is signed (if applicable)
5. Implementation handoff meeting is complete (if Go)

If No-Go: Engagement ends with documented blockers and recommendations.
Client retains all deliverables. No refund for completed work.

---

## Next Steps After Blueprint

If Go decision:
- Implementation engagement begins (separate scope/pricing)
- Blueprint artifacts become implementation requirements
- Named decision-maker continues as primary contact

If No-Go:
- Client retains all artifacts
- Blockers documented for future reference
- Re-engagement possible after blockers resolved
