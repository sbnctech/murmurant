    **Internal Developer Documentation for Murmurant API**

    This documentation covers ALL Murmurant APIs including public, member, admin, officer, and internal endpoints.
    It is intended for developers, tech leads, reviewers, and future maintainers.

    ## Authentication

    Murmurant uses session-based authentication with HttpOnly cookies. For local development and testing:

    - **Cookie-based auth**: The primary method. Session cookies are set after login.
    - **Test tokens (dev only)**: Use headers like `x-admin-test-token: dev-admin-token` for E2E tests.
    - **Bearer tokens (dev only)**: Format: `Bearer test-{role}-{memberId}` (e.g., `test-admin-123`)

    **IMPORTANT**: Never embed real tokens in documentation or code. Use placeholder values.

    ## Testing Endpoints Safely

    1. Use the dev environment only for testing
    2. Use test tokens with `x-admin-test-token` header
    3. Never test destructive operations against production data

    ## Error Responses

    All endpoints return standardized error responses:
    - `400` - Validation error (bad request body/params)
    - `401` - Unauthorized (missing or invalid auth)
    - `403` - Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
    - `404` - Resource not found
    - `429` - Rate limited
    - `500` - Internal server error
