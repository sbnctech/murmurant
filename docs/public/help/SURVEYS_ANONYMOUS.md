# Anonymous Surveys

## Overview

Anonymous surveys let you collect honest feedback without linking responses to specific members.

## When to Use Anonymous Surveys

- Post-event feedback
- Member satisfaction surveys
- Sensitive topic polls
- Any time you want candid responses

## How Anonymity Works

When you mark a survey as anonymous:

**We record:**

- Your answers
- Submission timestamp

**We do NOT record:**

- Your name or member ID
- Your email address
- Your IP address

## What Respondents See

Before submitting an anonymous survey, members see a clear disclosure:

> **This survey is ANONYMOUS**
>
> Your responses will NOT be linked to your name or profile.

This transparency helps members feel confident sharing honest feedback.

## Setting Up an Anonymous Survey

1. Go to **Surveys** → **Create New**
2. Choose your survey type
3. Check **"Make this survey anonymous"**
4. Add your questions
5. Publish and share

## Important Notes

- **Small groups**: In surveys sent to small groups, responses may be indirectly identifiable based on content or timing. Consider this when surveying small activity groups.

- **Election mode**: For board elections and bylaw votes, use the **Election** survey type, which provides verified anonymous voting (confirms eligibility without linking votes to voters).
