## The Name

### Q: Why is it called Murmurant?

**Short answer:** It comes from "murmuration" - when thousands of starlings fly together as one. No single bird leads; they move by responding to their neighbors. That's how the best organizations work too.

**Longer answer:** A murmuration is one of nature's most beautiful examples of collective coordination. Thousands of birds move in perfect sync without any central leader - each one simply responds to its neighbors, following simple rules. From that simplicity emerges something extraordinary.

That's the philosophy behind Murmurant. We help your committees, volunteers, and members stay coordinated - not through rigid top-down control, but through clear, simple tools that let people work together naturally.

The word "murmurant" itself means "that which murmurs" - the soft sound of many voices together. It felt right for software meant to amplify communities, not replace them.

### Q: How do you pronounce it?

**MUR-mur-ant** (rhymes with "current")

### Q: Is it a real word?

Yes. "Murmurant" appears in the Oxford English Dictionary. It's an archaic/poetic adjective meaning "murmuring" or "that which murmurs." It comes from Latin *murmurare* (to make a low, continuous sound).

## The Platform

### Q: What does Murmurant do?

Murmurant is membership and event management software for community organizations. It helps clubs:

- Manage member records and renewals
- Coordinate events and registrations

- Communicate with members
- Track organizational history

### Q: How is it different from Wild Apricot / ClubExpress / other platforms?

- **Designed for nonprofits by nonprofit people** - We understand volunteer-run organizations
- **Flexible policies** - Adapts to your bylaws, not the other way around
- **Clear audit trails** - Every action is logged and explainable
- **Modern, intuitive interface** - Less training needed for volunteers
- **No hidden complexity** - If you can't see it, it's not happening

### Q: Who built it?

Murmurant was developed by the Santa Barbara Newcomers Club as an independent, clean-room implementation. No code was copied from any existing platform. Development uses AI-assisted tools under human oversight, with full audit trails and IP hygiene documentation.

## For Board Members

### Q: Why did we need new software?

The previous platform (Wild Apricot) served us well, but we identified several pain points:

- Complex workflows that confused volunteers
- Limited ability to enforce our specific bylaws and policies
- Difficulty auditing who did what and when
- Rising costs and platform lock-in concerns

Murmurant addresses these by putting organization-specific policies at the center of the design.

### Q: Is our data safe?

Yes. Murmurant includes:

- Full audit logging of all administrative actions
- Role-based access control (people only see what they need)
- Data backup and recovery procedures
- No sharing of member data with third parties

### Q: What happens if the tech lead leaves?

Murmurant is fully documented with:

- Complete source code ownership
- Operational runbooks
- Architecture documentation
- No vendor lock-in

Any competent developer can maintain and extend the system.

### Q: How much does it cost?

Murmurant is developed in-house. Ongoing costs are:

- Hosting: ~$20/month (Netlify + Neon database)
- Domain: ~$15/year
- Email delivery: ~$20/month (Resend)

Total: approximately $50/month for a full-featured platform.
