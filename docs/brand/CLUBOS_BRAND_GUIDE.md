## 1. Brand Overview

### Mission

**"Empowering communities to thrive"**

ClubOS exists to give clubs and community organizations the tools they need to flourish. We remove administrative friction so leaders can focus on what matters: bringing people together.

### Vision

**Modern club management that feels human**

We believe software should adapt to how people naturally work, not the other way around. ClubOS combines powerful capabilities with intuitive design, making sophisticated club management accessible to everyone.

### Values

- **Simplicity** - We eliminate complexity. Every feature should feel obvious and every workflow should be streamlined. If it takes more than three clicks, we rethink it.

- **Connection** - We strengthen bonds between people. Our platform facilitates meaningful relationships, not just transactions. Members should feel welcomed, not processed.

- **Trust** - We earn confidence through transparency and reliability. Data is protected, actions are auditable, and the system works when you need it.

- **Joy** - We believe administrative work can be delightful. Small moments of polish and thoughtfulness transform routine tasks into pleasant experiences.

## 2. Logo Usage

### Primary Logo (Horizontal Wordmark + Symbol)

The primary logo combines the ClubOS wordmark with the community symbol. Use this version whenever space permits.

```
[Symbol] ClubOS
```

**Usage guidelines:**

- Use on website headers, marketing materials, and official documents
- Preferred for introductions where brand recognition is being established
- Always maintain horizontal orientation

### Bug (Icon Only)

The bug is the standalone symbol, used when the full logo won't fit or when ClubOS is already established in context.

```
[Symbol]
```

**Usage guidelines:**

- Use for favicons, app icons, and social media avatars
- Appropriate for small UI elements where text would be illegible
- Use only when ClubOS has already been identified elsewhere on the page/screen

### Clear Space Rules

Maintain minimum clear space around the logo equal to the height of the "O" in ClubOS. This ensures the logo remains visually distinct and uncluttered.

```
    ┌─────────────────────────┐
    │                         │
    │   [Symbol] ClubOS       │
    │                         │
    └─────────────────────────┘

    Clear space = height of "O" on all sides
```

**Never:**

- Place the logo on busy backgrounds without sufficient contrast
- Crowd the logo with other elements
- Place text or graphics within the clear space zone

### Minimum Sizes

To ensure legibility and brand integrity, observe these minimum sizes:

| Logo Version | Print (mm) | Digital (px) |
|--------------|------------|--------------|
| Primary Logo | 25mm wide  | 120px wide   |
| Bug Only     | 10mm wide  | 32px wide    |

**Below these sizes:**

- The wordmark becomes illegible
- Fine details in the symbol are lost
- Use the bug instead of the full logo when space is constrained

## 5. Voice & Tone

### Brand Voice

ClubOS speaks with:

- **Clarity** - We say what we mean, simply and directly

- **Confidence** - We're helpful experts, not pushy salespeople
- **Respect** - We value our users' time and intelligence

### Tone Variations

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Success messages | Encouraging, celebratory | "You're all set! The event is now live." |
| Error messages | Helpful, non-blaming | "We couldn't save your changes. Check your connection and try again." |
| Empty states | Inviting, actionable | "No events yet. Create your first one to get started." |
| Confirmations | Clear, reassuring | "This will remove the member from the committee. They'll keep their club membership." |

### Writing Guidelines

- **Use "you" and "your"** - Speak directly to the user
- **Avoid jargon** - Say "members" not "stakeholders"
- **Be specific** - Say "3 members registered" not "some members registered"
- **Use active voice** - Say "You created an event" not "An event was created"
