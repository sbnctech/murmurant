## Writing Guidelines

### Do

- Use active voice ("We sent your confirmation" not "Your confirmation was sent")
- Front-load important information
- Use "you" and "your" to speak directly to members
- Break up long text with headers and bullet points
- Include clear calls to action

### Don't

- Use jargon or acronyms without explanation
- Write paragraphs when bullets will do
- Use passive voice unless necessary
- Say "please be advised" or "kindly note"
- Use ALL CAPS for emphasis (use **bold** instead)

### Numbers and Dates

- Spell out numbers one through nine, use digits for 10+
- Use 12-hour time with am/pm: "2:00 pm" not "14:00"
- Write dates as: "Saturday, January 15" not "01/15/2025"
- Use "noon" and "midnight" instead of "12:00 pm/am"

### Punctuation

- Use the Oxford comma: "hiking, biking, and swimming"
- One space after periods
- Use em dashes (—) sparingly for emphasis
- Avoid exclamation points except in celebratory contexts

## Channel-Specific Guidelines

### Email

- Subject lines: Clear and specific, under 50 characters
- Preview text: Complement (don't repeat) the subject line
- Body: Front-load the key message, keep paragraphs short
- Sign-off: "The [Club Name] Team" or specific sender name

### SMS/Text

- No marketing fluff

### In-App Notifications
