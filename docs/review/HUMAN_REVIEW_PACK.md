# Human Review Pack

**Status**: Requires Human Review and Decision
**Source**: [SBNC_BUSINESS_MODEL.md](../ORG/SBNC_BUSINESS_MODEL.md)
**Purpose**: Capture items that require human judgment, not automated resolution

---

## Overview

This document contains items that were identified during documentation development
but require human decision-making. These are not bugs or technical issues - they
are strategic choices that should be made by SBNC leadership, not by AI assistants
or developers.

**Action Required**: A human (typically President or Board) should review each
section and make decisions or provide clarification.

## Section 1: Sensitive Phrasing Checklist

The following phrases in ClubOS documentation may be interpreted differently than
intended. Please review and confirm or revise:

### 1.1 "Fear" Language

**Current phrasing**: "Fear is the primary barrier to participation"

**Concern**: Some members may find the word "fear" overly dramatic or dismissive.
Alternative phrasings could include "uncertainty," "hesitation," or "anxiety."

- [ ] Keep "fear" as the primary term
- [ ] Replace with "uncertainty" throughout
- [ ] Replace with "hesitation" throughout
- [ ] Use mixed terminology depending on context
- [ ] Other: ________________________________________________

### 1.2 "Newbie" Terminology

**Current phrasing**: Internal systems use "newbie" for new members.

**Concern**: "Newbie" may feel diminishing to some members. Name tags already
use "New Member" instead.

- [ ] Keep "newbie" for internal/technical use, "New Member" for member-facing
- [ ] Replace "newbie" everywhere with "new member"
- [ ] Other: ________________________________________________

### 1.3 "$50K Buffer" Transparency

**Current phrasing**: Documentation openly states the $50K buffer policy.

**Concern**: Is this level of financial transparency appropriate for all
audiences? Should it be in member-facing vs. leadership-only documentation?

- [ ] Keep $50K figure in all documentation
- [ ] Keep $50K figure in leadership docs only, describe as "operating reserve" elsewhere
- [ ] Other: ________________________________________________

### 1.4 "Third-Year Member Problem"

**Current phrasing**: "The third-year member problem"

**Concern**: Framing third-year members as a "problem" may be negative. Could
reframe as "third-year transition" or "third-year opportunity."

- [ ] Keep "problem" - it's accurate and motivates action
- [ ] Reframe as "third-year transition"
- [ ] Reframe as "third-year opportunity"
- [ ] Other: ________________________________________________

## Section 2: Surprising Assumptions Checklist

The following assumptions are embedded in the documentation. Please verify these
match Board expectations:

### 2.1 Surplus Spending Priority

**Assumption**: "Surplus above $50K should be spent, not accumulated."

**Question**: Is the Board comfortable with this as documented policy? Some
organizations prefer building larger reserves.

- [ ] Confirmed - surplus should be spent on participation/volunteer support
- [ ] Modify - allow for strategic accumulation up to $____
- [ ] Other: ________________________________________________

### 2.2 Volunteer Sustainability Over Heroics

**Assumption**: "The club should never depend on any volunteer working
unsustainable hours, even if it means doing less."

**Question**: Is the Board comfortable with "do less" as a valid response
to volunteer strain?

- [ ] Confirmed - reduce scope rather than burn out volunteers
- [ ] Modify - context-dependent decision
- [ ] Other: ________________________________________________

### 2.3 Mentor as Universal First Step

**Assumption**: "Mentor is designed as the smallest possible volunteer
commitment and the standard entry point to volunteering."

**Question**: Is this accurate, or are there other entry points that should
be equally promoted?

- [ ] Confirmed - Mentor is the primary volunteer entry point
- [ ] Modify - other entry points should be equally emphasized: ________________
- [ ] Other: ________________________________________________

### 2.4 ClubOS as Friction Reducer

**Assumption**: "ClubOS exists primarily to reduce friction, not to enforce
compliance or create structure."

**Question**: Is this the right framing, or should ClubOS also serve
compliance/structure purposes?

- [ ] Confirmed - friction reduction is primary
- [ ] Modify - compliance and structure are equally important
- [ ] Other: ________________________________________________

## Section 3: Strategic Decisions

### FROZEN DECISIONS (Do Not Revisit Without Board Action)

The following decisions have been made and documented in
[SBNC_BUSINESS_MODEL.md](../ORG/SBNC_BUSINESS_MODEL.md):

#### 3.1 Who Owns the Mentor Role Long-Term?

**DECISION: VP Membership**

- VP Membership is responsible for assigning mentors, tracking mentorship
  relationships, and coordinating mentor recognition.
- This aligns with VP Membership's existing responsibility for new member
  onboarding.

**Status**: FROZEN - 2025-12-16

#### 3.2 Is Mentor Ever a Prerequisite for Other Leadership?

**DECISION: No, but it is the gateway**

- Mentor does NOT qualify for third-year membership by itself
- Mentor IS the gateway to qualifying volunteer roles
- Being a Mentor is strongly encouraged as the first volunteer step
- Mentoring is not strictly required before other volunteer roles

**Rationale**: Mentor is designed to be low-barrier and inviting. Making it a
hard prerequisite would undermine its purpose as a welcoming first step.

**Status**: FROZEN - 2025-12-16

#### 3.3 What Is the Mentor Role Classification?

**DECISION: Mentor is a VOLUNTEER role**

- Mentor is a first-class volunteer position
- It is not an informal helper role or administrative classification
- Mentors are recognized as volunteers in club communications

**Status**: FROZEN - 2025-12-16

## Section 4: Failure Scenario Narrative

**Purpose**: Describe what "breaking the flywheel" looks like in practice so
leadership can recognize warning signs.

### 4.1 Narrative Template

Please review and modify this failure scenario to ensure it matches realistic
organizational risks:

---

**Scenario: The Slow Stall**

*Year 1 of the stall:*

- Event attendance is down 15% but event count is stable
- VP Activities says "people are just busy"
- Same 8 people are running 80% of events
- Three mentors are handling all new member assignments
- Third-year members are quietly not renewing

*Year 2 of the stall:*

- Two of the core 8 volunteers step back due to burnout
- Events are canceled due to lack of chairs
- New member join rate drops 20% (word of mouth declines)
- Mentor program is "on pause" because no one has time to coordinate it
- Board discusses "how to get more volunteers" but takes no action

*Year 3 of the stall:*

- Financial reserves are tapped to cover event deposits with low attendance
- President is doing VP Activities job because position is unfilled
- Members describe the club as "cliquey" to newcomers
- Remaining volunteers feel unappreciated and bitter
- Board meeting attendance is inconsistent

*The flywheel has stopped.*
