                        <p class="dateline"><strong>BAY CITY, MI</strong> — Congressional candidate Jordan Lee today announced plans for a new advanced manufacturing facility that will bring clean energy component production to Bay City.</p>
                        
                        <p>"After years of watching jobs leave our community, we're finally seeing investment come back," said Lee. "This facility will create good-paying manufacturing jobs and help position mid-Michigan as a leader in the clean energy economy."</p>
                        
                        <p>The project will address the current high unemployment in the district which is over 50% greater than the national average. Lee emphasized that this investment represents the kind of economic development the region needs.</p>
                        
                        <p>"As mayor of Flint, I learned that economic recovery doesn't happen by accident—it takes partnerships between business, government, and labor working together," Lee continued. "That's exactly what we're building here."</p>
                        
                        <p>The facility is expected to begin operations in the coming years and will focus on producing components for renewable energy systems. Local labor unions have expressed support for the project.</p>
                        
                        <p>"This is about more than just one factory," Lee said. "It's about proving that mid-Michigan can compete in the industries of the future while creating opportunities for working families today."</p>
