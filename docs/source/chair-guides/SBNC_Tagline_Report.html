  <h1>SBNC Tagline Ballot Results Report</h1>
  <p class="subtitle"><strong>Prepared for:</strong> SBNC Communications &amp; Membership Committees</p>
  <p class="purpose"><strong>Purpose:</strong> Evaluate community endorsement of five potential taglines using a weighted ranking ballot.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>1. Overview of the Ballot Process</h2>
  <p>Members were asked to rank five candidate taglines. Points were assigned using a <strong>3–2–1 weighted system</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1st choice = 3 points</li>
    <li>2nd choice = 2 points</li>
    <li>3rd choice = 1 point</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Total scores reflect <strong>aggregate preference strength</strong>, not the number of voters.</p>

  <p>The five tested taglines were:</p>
  <ol>
    <li class="tagline-quote">“The Community that makes Santa Barbara feel like home.”</li>
    <li class="tagline-quote">“Connections that make Santa Barbara feel like home.”</li>
    <li class="tagline-quote">“Connect. Belong. Thrive in Santa Barbara.”</li>
    <li class="tagline-quote">“Find your people. Feel at home in SB — fast.”</li>
    <li class="tagline-quote">“New City, new friends, nonstop fun.”</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>5. Interpretation of Quantitative Results</h2>

  <h3>5.1 Clear Winner</h3>
  <p><span class="tagline-quote">“Connect. Belong. Thrive in Santa Barbara.”</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Highest total score (34)</li>
    <li>Largest number of first-place points</li>
    <li>Strong performance across all three ranking tiers</li>
    <li>Resonates broadly and deeply with the respondents</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This tagline would “win” under multiple reasonable voting systems (Borda-style scoring, simple plurality, or ranked choice), which indicates a robust underlying preference, not a fluke of the scoring method.</p>

  <h3>5.2 Strong Runner-Up</h3>
  <p><span class="tagline-quote">“New City, new friends, nonstop fun.”</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Second-highest score (32)</li>
    <li>Very strong in 1st- and 3rd-place points</li>
    <li>More energetic and youth-oriented tone than the winner</li>
    <li>Appeals to newcomers who prioritize social activity and rapid integration</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This tagline has a different personality from the winner but is consistently favored, suggesting a meaningful subgroup that responds strongly to a high-energy pitch.</p>

  <h3>5.3 Solid Third Place</h3>
  <p><span class="tagline-quote">“The Community that makes Santa Barbara feel like home.”</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Strong second-place support</li>
    <li>More traditional, community-minded tone</li>
    <li>Likely to appeal to members who value stability, continuity, and a “home base” feeling</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5.4 Weak Support for the Remaining Taglines</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="tagline-quote">“Connections that make Santa Barbara feel like home.”</span> is very similar in concept to “The Community that makes Santa Barbara feel like home.” but tested weaker, suggesting redundancy and vote-splitting with a less compelling phrasing.</li>
    <li><span class="tagline-quote">“Find your people. Feel at home in SB — fast.”</span> is action-oriented and emphasizes speed, but the “fast” promise may feel transactional or superficial for some respondents.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Both trailing taglines underperform across all three ranking tiers, indicating that they are unlikely to be competitive finalists.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>6. Patterns and Insights Beyond the Numbers</h2>

  <h3>6.1 Two Clear Clusters Emerge</h3>
  <p>The five taglines fall into two thematic families based on content and tone.</p>

  <p class="cluster-title">Cluster A — Belonging &amp; Community (Warmer, Broader Appeal)<br>
  Taglines: “The Community that makes Santa Barbara feel like home.”, “Connections that make Santa Barbara feel like home.”, “Connect. Belong. Thrive in Santa Barbara.”</p>

  <p><strong>Traits:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Emphasize emotional grounding and a sense of home</li>
    <li>Speak to deeper human needs: connection, belonging, community</li>
    <li>Frame SBNC as more than a social calendar — as a real community</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Performance:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>“Connect. Belong. Thrive in Santa Barbara.” clearly dominates this cluster by using modern, active verbs and a concise three-part structure.</li>
    <li>“The Community that makes Santa Barbara feel like home.” performs respectably but with a softer, more traditional feel.</li>
    <li>“Connections that make Santa Barbara feel like home.” appears to be a weaker variant of the same idea, diluting support without adding distinct value.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
  <span class="arrow">➤</span> Voters prefer a modern, concise, active version of the belonging/community message, which is captured best by “Connect. Belong. Thrive in Santa Barbara.”</p>

  <p class="cluster-title">Cluster B — Fun &amp; Energy (Social Momentum)<br>
  Taglines: “Find your people. Feel at home in SB — fast.”, “New City, new friends, nonstop fun.”</p>

  <p><strong>Traits:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Emphasize speed, activity, and enthusiasm</li>
    <li>Convey that SBNC helps newcomers get “plugged in” quickly</li>
    <li>Use a more casual, youthful, and high-energy tone</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Performance:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>“New City, new friends, nonstop fun.” is a strong second overall, showing genuine demand for a fun-first, social-energy message.</li>
    <li>“Find your people. Feel at home in SB — fast.” likely loses some respondents with the explicit emphasis on speed (“fast”), which can sound more transactional than relational.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
  <span class="arrow">➤</span> When respondents favor a fun-first tagline, “New City, new friends, nonstop fun.” clearly captures that sentiment more effectively than the alternatives.</p>

  <h3>6.2 Why “Connect. Belong. Thrive in Santa Barbara.” Wins Across the Board</h3>
  <p>The winning tagline successfully blends the emotional grounding of Cluster A with some of the forward motion and optimism associated with Cluster B.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Not too formal, not too breezy</li>
    <li>Flexible for multiple audiences and age groups</li>
    <li>Aligned with the Club’s mission: helping newcomers settle, connect, and flourish in Santa Barbara</li>
    <li>Short, memorable, and visually clean for use in headers, banners, and digital layouts</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In other words, <span class="tagline-quote">“Connect. Belong. Thrive in Santa Barbara.”</span> communicates both belonging and momentum — which is exactly what newcomers are looking for when they decide whether SBNC will help Santa Barbara feel like home.</p>

  <h3>6.3 Strategic Implication for SBNC</h3>
  <p>The winning tagline is not only the top-rated; it is also strategically versatile:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Works across demographics (20s, 30s, retirees, job relocations, life transitions)</li>
    <li>Compatible with SBNC’s historic positioning as a welcoming, community-oriented organization</li>
    <li>Supports both social and community-focused messaging campaigns</li>
    <li>Easy to reuse as a unifying phrase in email marketing, web content, and print materials</li>
  </ul>
  <p>“New City, new friends, nonstop fun.” can be retained as an alternate “youth + social energy” subtagline for specific contexts (e.g., newcomers’ events, mixers, or campaigns focused on younger cohorts).</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>7. Recommendation</h2>

  <p><strong>Primary Tagline for SBNC</strong></p>
  <p><span class="arrow">➡️</span> <span class="tagline-quote">“Connect. Belong. Thrive in Santa Barbara.”</span></p>

  <p><strong>Optional Secondary / Context-Specific Tagline</strong></p>
  <p><span class="arrow">➡️</span> <span class="tagline-quote">“New City, new friends, nonstop fun.”</span></p>

  <p>This pairing allows the club to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintain a strong, universal brand message centered on connection and belonging</li>
    <li>Use a more energetic, fun-forward secondary message when appropriate</li>
    <li>Appeal to both major motivational clusters identified in the ballot results</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>8. Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The ballot results clearly show that <span class="tagline-quote">“Connect. Belong. Thrive in Santa Barbara.”</span> is the preferred choice, with strong preference depth, broad appeal across ranking tiers, and thematic alignment with SBNC’s mission and values.</p>
  <p>Patterns across the taglines reveal two distinct motivational clusters among respondents—Belonging/Community and Fun/Energy—with the winning tagline excelling because it effectively bridges both. This gives SBNC a strong, flexible foundation for future communications and branding efforts.</p>
