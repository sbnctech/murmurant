# Board Memo: Policy Gaps, Contradictions, and Required Approvals

**To:** SBNC Board of Directors
**From:** Murmurant Development Team
**Date:** December 20, 2025
**Re:** Policy Registry Findings Requiring Board Action

---

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive policy harvest and registry normalization has been completed. This memo consolidates findings that require Board attention before Murmurant can safely automate policy enforcement.

**Key Statistics:**

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Policies registered | 3 |
| Pending authority resolution | 6 categories |
| Contradictions identified | 3 |
| Acknowledgements requiring clarification | 6 |
| Documents needing visibility decision | 2 |

---

## Part 1: Required Board Decisions

### 1.1 Policy Visibility Decisions

Two policies have unclear visibility settings. Murmurant cannot implement access controls without Board direction.

| Policy | Current Status | Options | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|---------|----------------|
| Privacy Policy and Terms of Use | Unclear | Public / Members | **Public** (industry standard) |
| Social Media Policy | Unclear | Members / Admins only | **Members** (awareness value) |

**Action Required:** Board vote to set visibility for each policy.

---

### 1.2 Acknowledgement Frequency Decisions

Six acknowledgement requirements have undefined frequency. Murmurant event submission workflow (Phase 2) depends on these decisions.

| Acknowledgement | Current | Options | Impact |
|-----------------|---------|---------|--------|
| Code of Conduct | Unknown | Once at join / Annually / Per-event | Membership + Event submission |
| Liability Waiver | Unknown | At join (blanket) / Per-event | Event registration flow |
| Media Release | Unknown | Once / Per-event with opt-out | Photo consent tracking |
| Privacy Policy | Unknown | Explicit acknowledgement / Implied | Membership flow |
| Board/Chair P&P familiarity | Unknown | Formal acknowledgement / Knowledge expectation | Role assignment |
| Phase 2 event acknowledgements | Proposed | Per-event / Annual | Event submission UI |

**Action Required:** Board decision on each frequency setting.

---

### 1.3 Bylaws Status Confirmation

The bylaws document in the registry is titled "Draft with All Amendments." Board must confirm:

| Question | Options |
|----------|---------|
| Which version is officially in force? | Confirm specific version |
| Have all amendments been adopted? | Yes / No / Partial |
| Where are adoption records? | Provide meeting minutes reference |

**Action Required:** Secretary to locate adoption records; Board to confirm in-force version.

---

## Part 2: Contradictions Requiring Resolution

### 2.1 Home Event "No Exceptions" vs. Host Guest Privileges

**Contradiction:**

- Non-Member and Guest Policy §5.1 states: "No Exceptions: Restriction applies to all non-members including alumni"
- Same section states: "Home hosts may invite up to two (2) personal guests per Policies and Procedures"

**Question:** Are hosts' personal guests exempt from the members-only rule?

**Options:**
1. Confirm hosts may invite 2 personal guests (exception exists)
2. Remove host guest privilege (strict members-only)
3. Clarify that host guests are members' spouses/partners only

**Action Required:** Board clarification.

---

### 2.2 Membership Term Duration

**Contradiction:**

- Non-Member and Guest Policy: "2-3 years total" membership
- Operational implementation: Three distinct 12-month tiers (Year 1 + Year 2 + Year 3 = 36 months max)

**Question:** Is the third year optional/earned, or is maximum membership always 3 years?

**Options:**
1. Maximum 2 years; third year is earned extension (current understanding)
2. Maximum 3 years for all members
3. Clarify criteria for third-year extension

**Action Required:** Board confirmation of membership term rules.

---

### 2.3 Registration Eligibility Enforcement

**Issue:** Operational data shows 196 members with expired memberships registered for 1,988 events.

**Question:** Is this a system bug or an intentional grace period?

**Options:**
1. Bug - enforce strict eligibility (expired members blocked)
2. Grace period - define and document (e.g., 30 days post-expiration)
3. Exception process - define who can override

**Action Required:** Board decision on enforcement policy.

---

## Part 3: Fee Schedule Documentation

The following fees are referenced in operational documents but no formal Board-approved fee schedule was located:

| Fee | Amount Referenced | Source | Status |
|-----|-------------------|--------|--------|
| Year 1 Dues | Not stated | Bylaws Art. III §3 defers to Board | **Missing** |
| Year 2 Dues | Not stated | — | **Missing** |
| Third-Year Extension Fee | $85 | Business Model document | **Unconfirmed** |
| Alumni Annual Fee | $25 | Non-Member and Guest Policy | **Unconfirmed** |

**Action Required:**
1. Locate or create Board-approved fee schedule
2. Confirm fee amounts via Board resolution
3. Add fee schedule to policy registry

---

## Part 4: Commentary Requiring Formal Adoption

The following operational guidance items are documented but lack formal Board adoption:

| Item | Source | Recommended Action |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| Mission Statement | Business Model v1.0 | Board resolution to adopt |
| Events as Core Function ("Flywheel") | Business Model v1.0 | Board resolution to adopt |
| $50,000 Cash Buffer Target | Business Model v1.0 | Board resolution to adopt |
| Event Cost Recovery Principle | Business Model v1.0 | Board resolution to adopt |
| Volunteer Pathway Model | Business Model v1.0 | Board resolution to adopt |

**Impact:** These items are marked COMMENTARY in the registry, not ADOPTED. Formal adoption creates clear authority for Murmurant enforcement.

**Action Required:** Board vote to adopt each item (or decline with rationale).

---

## Part 5: Missing Documents

The following documents are referenced in policies but were not located in the harvest:

| Document | Priority | Referenced By | Action |
|----------|----------|---------------|--------|
| Insurance Policy | P0 | Non-Member Guest Policy (home events) | Locate from carrier |
| Committee Chair Guidelines | P1 | Bylaws Preamble | VP Activities to provide |
| Standing Rules | P2 | General reference | Confirm if separate from bylaws |
| Board-Approved Fee Schedule | P0 | Bylaws Art. III §3 | Create or locate |

**Action Required:** Assign owners to locate each document.
