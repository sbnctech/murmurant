# Competitive Analysis: Wild Apricot and Market Landscape

**Last updated:** 2025-12-28

---

## Executive Summary

Wild Apricot dominates the small-to-medium membership organization market, but large national organizations (Rotary, Lions, BSA) operate proprietary centralized systems. ClubOS targets the underserved middle tier: independent clubs and local chapters that need more than Wild Apricot offers but don't have access to national-level platforms.

---

## Market Landscape

### Tier 1: Centralized National Systems

Large membership organizations with proprietary platforms managed at the national level:

| Organization | Platform | Notes |
|--------------|----------|-------|
| Rotary International | DACdb / ClubRunner | Centralized member database, club reporting |
| Lions Clubs International | Lion Portal | Global membership management |
| Boy Scouts of America | Scoutbook | Unit-level tracking, advancement |
| Kiwanis International | Kiwanis Connect | Club and district management |

**Key characteristics:**
- Mandated by national organization
- No market choice for local units
- Deep integration with national reporting
- NOT addressable market for ClubOS

### Tier 2: Chapter-Level Solutions

Chapters of larger organizations that have autonomy over their technology choices:

| Organization Type | Example Orgs | Current Solutions |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Professional associations | IREM, ATD, SHRM chapters | Wild Apricot, MemberClicks |
| Alumni groups | University clubs | Wild Apricot, custom |
| Trade associations | Local builder associations | GrowthZone, Wild Apricot |

**Key characteristics:**
- Local chapter autonomy
- Budget constraints ($50-500/mo range)
- Often using Wild Apricot or similar
- Addressable with right positioning

### Tier 3: Independent Clubs

Standalone organizations with no national affiliation:

| Club Type | Examples | Current Solutions |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Newcomer/social clubs | Santa Barbara Newcomers | Wild Apricot, spreadsheets |
| Hobby clubs | Garden clubs, car clubs | Wild Apricot, Facebook groups |
| Community groups | Neighborhood associations | Spreadsheets, nothing |

**Key characteristics:**
- Full technology autonomy

### Wild Apricot "Stripes" Layout System

**Architecture Constraint:**
Wild Apricot sites use a **stripe-based layout system** where pages are composed of horizontal full-width sections stacked vertically. This creates:

- Uniform horizontal bands across the page
- Limited grid flexibility within stripes
- Predictable but rigid page structures
- All consultant themes work within this constraint

**ClubOS Advantage:**
Our block-based CMS is NOT restricted to stripes. We can offer:

| Capability | Wild Apricot | ClubOS |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| Multi-column layouts | Limited within stripes | Full grid flexibility |
| Asymmetric grids | No | Yes |
| Sidebar + content | Theme-level only | Page-level choice |
| Magazine layouts | No | Yes |
| Card arrangements | Fixed patterns | Flexible placement |
| Nested blocks | No | Yes |

This architectural difference enables layouts that Wild Apricot simply cannot achieve regardless of consultant customization.
