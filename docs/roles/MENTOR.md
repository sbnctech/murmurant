## Frozen Decisions (Do Not Revisit Without Board Action)

1. **Mentor is a VOLUNTEER role** - A first-class volunteer position
2. **Mentor does NOT qualify for third-year membership by itself** - It is a
   gateway, not a destination
3. **Mentor is the gateway to qualifying volunteer roles** - Low-barrier entry point
4. **Mentor program is owned by VP Membership**

## Why Mentors Exist

From the [canonical grounding document](../ORG/SBNC_BUSINESS_MODEL.md):

> SBNC is a participation-driven nonprofit whose success depends on converting
> new members into confident participants and eventually volunteers and leaders.

The Mentor role is the **first step in the volunteering flywheel**. It exists to:

1. **Reduce fear** for new members by giving them a friendly point of contact
2. **Provide a low-barrier volunteer entry** for experienced members
3. **Bridge the gap** between "I just joined" and "I'm ready to serve"

## Mentor as Fear Reduction

Fear is the primary barrier to participation (see canonical grounding, Part 5).
New members experience:

- "Will I know anyone at my first event?"
- "What if I don't fit in?"
- "What are the unwritten rules?"

A Mentor answers these fears by being a known, friendly face who:
- Reaches out before the first event
- Answers questions about what to expect
- Optionally attends events together
- Checks in during the first 90 days

**The Mentor's job is to make being new less scary.**

## Mentor as Volunteer Entry Point

The canonical grounding document identifies the "third-year member problem":
members who plateau and leave because there is no clear "what's next."

Mentor is designed as the smallest possible volunteer commitment:

| Barrier | How Mentor Addresses It |
|---------|-------------------------|
| "I don't have time" | 1-2 hours over 90 days total |
| "I don't know what to do" | Simple, clear expectations |
| "What if I mess up?" | Zero governance responsibility |
| "I'm not ready to lead" | You're not leading - you're welcoming |

After someone has been a Mentor, they see themselves as "someone who volunteers"
rather than "just a member." This identity shift makes future volunteer
recruitment easier.

## What Mentors Do and Don't Do

### Do

- Welcome contact within 7 days of assignment
- Answer questions about club activities and norms
- Optionally attend 1-2 events with their newbie
- Check in monthly during first 90 days
- Connect newbie to others with shared interests

### Don't

- Make policy decisions (not a governance actor)
- Handle money (that's Treasurer scope)
- Chair events (that's Event Chair scope)
- Resolve conflicts (escalate to VP Activities)
- Guarantee outcomes (success = newbie knows someone)

## Connection to Action Log

Mentor activities generate the following action log entries:

- `mentor.assigned` - When a mentor is assigned to a newbie
- `mentor_newbie.registered_same_event` - When both register for same event
- `mentor_newbie.attended_same_event` - When both attend same event

See [LEADERSHIP_ACTION_LOG.md](../governance/LEADERSHIP_ACTION_LOG.md) for details.
