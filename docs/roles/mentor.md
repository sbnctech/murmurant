# Mentor Role

## Purpose
The mentor role exists to reduce anxiety and friction for new members during their earliest interactions with SBNC.

Mentors help new members cross the gap between joining and attending their first events.

---

## What Mentors Do
- Welcome new members
- Answer basic questions about events and culture
- Accompany or coordinate meeting at first events when helpful
- Provide social reassurance, not instructions

The mentor role is primarily social, not administrative.

---

## What Mentors Are Not Responsible For
- Managing registrations
- Fixing technical problems
- Recruiting volunteers
- Retaining members long-term
- Being constantly available

Mentors are not support staff.

---

## Time Scope
Mentorship is intentionally time-boxed:
- Typically 30–60 days
- Ends naturally after first events and introductions

This prevents burnout and keeps the role lightweight.

---

## Why This Role Matters
New members often hesitate due to:
- Not knowing what is normal
- Fear of breaking something
- Uncertainty about where they belong

Mentors reduce these fears through simple human connection.

---

## Sustainability Principle
The mentor role exists to protect the membership flywheel without overloading volunteers.

It should remain:
- Optional
- Clearly scoped
- Easy to step into and out of

Mentorship strengthens the system when it is lightweight.
