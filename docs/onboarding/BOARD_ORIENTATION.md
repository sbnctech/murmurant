# Board Orientation

**Canonical Grounding**: [ORG/SBNC_BUSINESS_MODEL.md](../ORG/SBNC_BUSINESS_MODEL.md)
**Audience**: New board members

## Welcome to the Board

Thank you for joining the SBNC Board of Directors. This document provides the
foundational context you need to be effective in governance.

Before your first board meeting, please read this document and the
[canonical grounding document](../ORG/SBNC_BUSINESS_MODEL.md).
These will help you understand the organizational model you are governing.

---

## What SBNC Is

SBNC is a **participation-driven nonprofit**. Unlike organizations that measure
success by membership count, SBNC measures success by:

- Event attendance (are members showing up?)
- Return attendance (do first-timers come back?)
- Volunteer pipeline (are participants stepping up?)
- Leadership pipeline (are volunteers progressing?)

**A club with 500 members where 50 participate is less healthy than a club with
200 members where 100 participate.**

As a board member, your governance decisions should protect and strengthen the
member journey from new member to confident participant to volunteer to leader.

---

## The Flywheel Model

SBNC operates on a flywheel where each part reinforces the others:

```
Events attract members
    |
    v
Members who participate feel connected
    |
    v
Connected members become volunteers
    |
    v
Volunteers enable more events
    |
    (cycles back to top)
```

### Flywheel Break Points

The flywheel can stall at several points. As a board member, watch for:

| Break Point | Warning Sign | Board Response |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| No events | Calendar gaps, declining variety | Review VP Activities support |
| Events but no welcome | Low return attendance | Review mentor program health |
| No volunteer pipeline | Same few people doing everything | Review recruitment strategy |
| No leadership pipeline | Unfilled board positions | Review succession planning |

---

## Financial Model

### The $50,000 Buffer

SBNC maintains a $50,000 cash buffer. This is strategic infrastructure, not savings.

**The buffer enables:**
- Event commitment flexibility (book before revenue arrives)
- Bad-weather insurance (absorb cancellations)
- Volunteer sustainability (hire help when needed)
- Opportunity response (say yes to good ideas)

**Board responsibility:** Ensure the buffer stays at $50K. If it drops below,
prioritize restoring it. If it grows significantly above, prioritize spending
it on participation and volunteer support.

### Surplus Spending Philosophy

When surplus exists above the buffer, it should be spent on:

1. Subsidizing events (accessibility)
2. Hiring help (volunteer sustainability)
3. Systems investment (friction reduction)
4. Training (volunteer and leader development)

**Surplus should NOT:**
- Accumulate indefinitely
- Fund things that don't increase participation
- Become a governance burden through indecision

---

## Fear as Strategy

SBNC explicitly treats fear as the primary barrier to participation and
volunteering. This is not weakness - it is strategic.

| Fear Point | SBNC Response |
|------------|---------------|
| First event anxiety | Mentor program |
| Activity hesitation | Clear expectations, beginner options |
| Volunteer fear | Low-commitment entry points (Mentor role) |
| Leadership fear | Training, shadowing, clear scope |

**Board responsibility:** Ensure programs exist to reduce fear at each transition
point. When someone proposes a change, ask: "Does this increase or decrease
fear for members?"

---

## The Third-Year Member Problem

Members at year three face a decision: deepen, coast, or leave.

This is why:
- Third-year members are the primary volunteer recruitment pool
- The Mentor role exists as a low-barrier entry point
- ClubOS tracks member journey progression

**Board responsibility:** Monitor third-year retention. If third-year members
are leaving without volunteering, something is wrong with the volunteer pipeline.

---

## Governance Principles

### Capability Over Role

Authorization in SBNC follows capability-based thinking:

- "Can this person do this specific thing?" (good)
- "Is this person an admin?" (bad)

This matches organizational reality: a Treasurer can approve payments but not
edit events; an Event Chair can manage their event but not access finances.

### Transparency by Default

Members should understand:
- How decisions are made
- Who has what authority
- Financial position
- Why policies exist

**Board responsibility:** Default to transparency. When considering restricting
information, have a specific reason.

### Volunteer Sustainability Over Heroics

The club should not depend on any single volunteer working unsustainable hours.

**Board responsibility:** Monitor volunteer workload. When a volunteer is
overwhelmed, the response should be "reduce scope, recruit help, or pay for
help" - never "thank them for their sacrifice and keep going."

---

## ClubOS and Technology

ClubOS exists to support the flywheel. As a board member, you should understand
its purpose even if you don't use it daily:

1. **Reduces fear** - Clear information, mentor connections
2. **Increases clarity** - Visible event details, registration status
3. **Manages tension** - Balances capacity, supply, and demand
4. **Enables visibility** - Action Log shows organizational activity

ClubOS is a tool, not a replacement for human judgment.

---

## How the Board Uses the Action Log

The Action Log provides governance visibility without requiring daily system access.

### Monthly Board Digest

Each board meeting packet includes a one-page summary:

- Events held vs. cancelled - Flywheel health indicator
- Refund volume and top reasons - Policy effectiveness
- Membership net change - Growth trends
- Policy-triggering events - Items requiring board attention

### What the Board Should Watch

| Pattern | Implication | Board Response |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Rising cancellation rate | Volunteer strain or venue issues | Review event calendar density |
| Refund spike | Policy confusion or satisfaction issue | Review refund policy clarity |
| Waitlist frequency up | Demand exceeding supply | Consider capacity expansion |
| Same chairs running everything | Single points of failure | Review volunteer recruitment |
| Third-year members leaving | Pipeline problem | Review volunteer onboarding |

### What the Board Should NOT Watch

The Action Log deliberately excludes:

- Individual member browsing or login patterns
- Private mentor/newbie communications
- Draft saves or work-in-progress
- Day-to-day operational noise

**Board role is governance, not operations.** If you're looking at individual
member activity, you're too deep in the weeds.

### Reading the Log for Continuity

At leadership transitions, the Action Log provides:

- What the previous board dealt with
- Patterns that emerged over time
- Decisions made and their context
- Issues that were escalated vs. resolved operationally

This institutional memory reduces the "starting from scratch" feeling for new
board members.

---

## VP Membership and the Mentor Program

The Mentor program is owned by VP Membership. Board oversight includes:

| Oversight Level | What Board Reviews |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Health metrics | Mentor assignment rate, newbie engagement |
| Resource needs | Does VP Membership have enough mentor volunteers? |
| Escalations | Mentor issues that couldn't be resolved operationally |

Board does NOT:

- Review individual mentor/newbie pairings
- Read communication content
- Second-guess mentor assignments

**Trust the VP Membership to run the program; provide support when asked.**

---

## Understanding Financial Stabilizers

### The $50,000 Buffer is Insurance, Not Savings

The buffer enables the club to:

- Make commitments before revenue arrives (book venues)
- Absorb weather cancellations without panic
- Hire help during volunteer crunches
- Say yes to opportunities

**Board responsibility**: Keep the buffer at $50K. If below, prioritize restoration.
If above, prioritize spending on participation and sustainability.

### Surplus Spending as Stabilizer

Surplus above the buffer should be spent, not accumulated:

| Good Use | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Subsidize events | Keep activities accessible |
| Hire temporary help | Prevent volunteer burnout |
| Invest in systems | Reduce friction |
| Training programs | Build volunteer pipeline |

| Bad Use | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Grow buffer above $50K | Creates governance burden, doesn't improve participation |
| Fund non-participation items | Diverts from mission |
| Accumulate indefinitely | Eventually becomes a problem |

**Spending surplus is not reckless - it's strategic.** A club that hoards cash
while volunteers burn out has its priorities wrong.

---

## The Third-Year Decision Point

Members at year three face a fork:

```
Year 3 Member
     |
     +---> Deepen (volunteer/lead) ---> Retention + leadership pipeline
     |
     +---> Coast (attend, disengage) ---> Eventually leave
     |
     +---> Leave (drift away) ---> Lost potential
```

**Board responsibility**: Ensure pathways exist for deepening.

Signs the pathway is broken:

- Third-year members leaving at higher rates than years 1-2
- Volunteer positions staying unfilled
- Same people doing everything

The Mentor role was designed as the first step in the volunteer pipeline -
low commitment, clear scope, easy on-ramp.

---

## You Cannot Break the Club

A common board fear: "What if we make the wrong decision?"

The club has survived for decades. It will survive your tenure. The systems in
place provide:

- Audit trails for accountability
- Reversibility for most actions
- Transparency for course correction
- Buffers for financial mistakes

**Your job is to govern thoughtfully, not perfectly.** When in doubt, ask questions,
seek input, and make the best decision you can with available information.

The worst outcome is usually a slightly suboptimal decision that gets corrected
next quarter - not organizational collapse.

## Board Meeting Checklist

At each board meeting, consider:

- [ ] Flywheel health: Any break points emerging?
- [ ] Buffer status: Still at $50K?
- [ ] Volunteer sustainability: Anyone overwhelmed?
- [ ] Third-year retention: Any concerning patterns?
- [ ] Fear reduction: Are programs working?

---

## Questions to Ask in Your First 90 Days

1. What is the current cash position relative to the $50K buffer?
2. Which volunteer positions are strained or unfilled?
3. What is the event calendar for the next quarter?
4. How many active mentors are there? How many newbies are unassigned?
5. What was the last governance challenge the board faced?
6. What succession planning exists for current officers?
