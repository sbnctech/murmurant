# Officer Onboarding

**Canonical Grounding**: [ORG/SBNC_BUSINESS_MODEL.md](../ORG/SBNC_BUSINESS_MODEL.md)
**Audience**: New officers (VP Activities, VP Membership, Treasurer, Secretary, etc.)

## Welcome

Congratulations on becoming an SBNC officer. This document provides the
foundational context you need to be effective in your role.

Before diving into the specifics of your position, please read this document
and the [canonical grounding document](../ORG/SBNC_BUSINESS_MODEL.md)
it references. These will help you understand *why* SBNC operates the way it does.

---

## What SBNC Is (Summary)

SBNC is a **participation-driven nonprofit**. Our success depends on converting
new members into confident participants and eventually volunteers and leaders.

This is not just a nice goal - it is the core business model. If members don't
participate, they don't renew. If participants don't become volunteers, we can't
run events. If volunteers don't become leaders, governance gaps appear.

**Your job as an officer is to keep this flywheel spinning.**

---

## The Flywheel

```
Events attract members
    |
    v
Members who participate feel connected
    |
    v
Connected members become volunteers
    |
    v
Volunteers enable more events
    |
    (cycles back to top)
```

Every officer role touches this flywheel differently:

| Role | Primary Flywheel Contribution |
|------|-------------------------------|
| VP Activities | Creates events that attract and engage members |
| VP Membership | Welcomes new members, manages mentor program |
| Treasurer | Ensures financial stability for event commitments |
| Secretary | Documents decisions, maintains institutional memory |
| President | Coordinates across roles, resolves conflicts |

---

## The $50,000 Buffer

SBNC maintains a $50,000 cash buffer. This is not "savings" - it is operational
infrastructure that enables:

- **Event commitment flexibility** - Book venues before registration revenue
- **Bad-weather insurance** - Absorb a canceled event without crisis
- **Volunteer sustainability** - Hire help when volunteers are stretched thin
- **Opportunity response** - Say yes to unexpected opportunities

**As an officer, you should not hesitate to spend money on things that protect
participation or volunteer sustainability.** The buffer exists to be used, not
to grow indefinitely.

---

## Surplus Spending

When SBNC has surplus above the $50K buffer, priorities are:

1. Subsidize events to keep prices accessible
2. Hire temporary help to prevent volunteer burnout
3. Invest in systems that reduce friction
4. Training for volunteers and leaders

Surplus should NOT be used to:
- Build a larger buffer "just in case"
- Fund things that don't increase participation
- Be hoarded until it becomes a governance burden

---

## Fear as the Primary Barrier

Members and volunteers experience fear at multiple points:

- "Will I know anyone at my first event?"
- "What if I'm not good enough for this activity?"
- "What if I fail as a volunteer?"
- "What if I make a mistake as a leader?"

**SBNC's response to fear is "reduce the barrier," not "tough it out."**

This is why:
- The Mentor program exists (reduce first-event fear)
- Volunteer roles have clear, limited scope (reduce volunteer fear)
- Officer roles have defined boundaries (reduce leadership fear)

As an officer, when you see fear or hesitation, your job is to acknowledge it
and reduce it - not dismiss it.

## The Third-Year Member Problem

Research shows that members who reach their third year face a decision point:

- Year 1: Everything is new and exciting
- Year 2: Established patterns, regular attendance
- Year 3: "I've done most things, now what?"

At year three, members either deepen (volunteer/lead), coast, or leave.

**Third-year members are your ideal volunteer recruitment pool.** They know how
the club works, have relationships, and are looking for "what's next."

The Mentor role was specifically designed as a low-barrier entry point for
this group.

---

## ClubOS: Your Tool

ClubOS exists to support the flywheel by:

1. **Reducing fear** - Clear information, mentor connections
2. **Increasing clarity** - Visible event details, registration status
3. **Managing tension** - Balance capacity, volunteer supply, member demand
4. **Enabling visibility** - Action Log shows what's happening

ClubOS does NOT replace your judgment. It provides information and tools;
you make decisions.

---

## How to Read the Action Log

The Action Log is your institutional memory - it tells you what happened and why.
It exists for governance and continuity, not surveillance.

### Weekly Review (10 minutes)

Each week, glance at the log's summary view. You should be able to answer:

- Were any events cancelled? Why?
- Were any refunds processed? How many and what amounts?
- Did any waitlist promotions happen?
- Were there any capacity changes?

**If something looks wrong, investigate.** If everything looks normal, move on.

### What to Watch For

| Signal | Why It Matters | Your Response |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Event cancellation pattern | May indicate venue issues, volunteer strain, or low demand | Discuss with VP Activities |
| Refund spike | Policy confusion or member dissatisfaction | Review with Treasurer |
| Repeated waitlist situations | Demand exceeds supply for certain activities | Consider adding capacity or events |
| Capacity reductions | May signal chair availability issues | Check in with Event Chair |
| Mass email sent | Communications touchpoint | Ensure messaging aligns with club values |

### What to Ignore

The Action Log intentionally excludes noise. You should NOT look for:

- Login activity (security concern only)
- Page views or browsing patterns
- Draft event saves
- Private messages or mentor conversations

**If you find yourself wanting surveillance-level detail, pause.** The log is
designed to support trust, not undermine it.

### Reading Mentor Activity

The log shows mentor milestones, not message content:

- "Mentor assigned to newbie" - Assignment happened
- "Mentor outreach completed" - Contact was made
- "Newbie attended first event" - Progress!

You will NOT see message content, browsing behavior, or subjective assessments.
This protects the trust relationship between mentors and mentees.

---

## Mentor Program Ownership

**The VP Membership owns the Mentor program.**

This means:

| Responsibility | What It Looks Like |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Mentor recruitment | Identify third-year members; invite them to mentor |
| Assignment | Pair new members with available mentors |
| Check-ins | Monthly review of mentor dashboard |
| Recognition | Thank mentors; highlight success stories |
| Escalation | Handle stuck assignments (newbie not engaging) |

The VP Membership does NOT:
- Read mentor/newbie message content
- Micromanage mentor outreach timing
- Require detailed reports from mentors

**Success metric**: Newbies who have mentors attend their first event faster
and renew at higher rates than those without.

---

## You Can't Break It

A common fear: "What if I click the wrong thing?"

**You cannot break ClubOS in a way that harms the club.**

- Mistakes are logged and can be reviewed
- Edits can be undone
- No action is irreversible except event deletion (which requires admin)
- The system is designed for volunteers, not technology experts

If something seems wrong, stop and ask. The worst outcome is a slightly confused
event listing that gets fixed in five minutes.

**The system exists to serve you, not the other way around.**

## Key Documents to Read

In addition to this document, you should read:

1. [ORG/SBNC_BUSINESS_MODEL.md](../ORG/SBNC_BUSINESS_MODEL.md) - Full canonical grounding
2. Your role-specific documentation (if available)
3. [ARCHITECTURAL_CHARTER.md](../ARCHITECTURAL_CHARTER.md) - Technical principles
4. [LEADERSHIP_ACTION_LOG.md](../governance/LEADERSHIP_ACTION_LOG.md) - How activity is tracked

---

## Questions to Ask

During your first 30 days, find answers to these questions:

1. Who are the active mentors right now?
2. What events are coming up in the next 90 days?
3. What volunteer positions are unfilled or strained?
4. What was the most recent "close call" or crisis?
5. Who are the third-year members who haven't volunteered yet?

---

## When in Doubt

If you're unsure about a decision, ask:

- "Does this make participation easier or harder?"
- "Does this support or strain volunteers?"
- "Does this move someone along the member journey?"
- "Would I want this decision documented for the next person in this role?"

If the answer to any of these is concerning, pause and consult with the
President or other officers before proceeding.
