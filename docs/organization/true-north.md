# SBNC True North

## Why SBNC Exists
SBNC exists to help new residents thrive in Santa Barbara by helping them:
- Feel at home
- Know people
- Understand the community
- Build a lasting sense of belonging

SBNC is not an events business.
Events are the on-ramp to community.

## The Member Flywheel (Critical)
1. Join SBNC
2. Attend early events and social gatherings
3. Form personal connections
4. Join small groups, committees, or volunteer roles
5. Become long-term, contributing members and leaders

If step 2 fails, the flywheel breaks.

---

## The Core Risk
If new members do not attend events shortly after joining:
- They disengage
- They do not enter the funnel
- They do not become long-term members
- The club becomes brittle

This is the single most important operational risk.

---

## Known Barriers to Entry
- Events sold out when members first join
- Uncertainty about which events are right for them
- Introversion and shyness
- Fear of awkwardness
- Missing orientation opportunities
- Weak signaling of member status

---

## How SBNC Intentionally Addresses These
- Reserved newbie tickets released near event dates
- Mentor program pairing new and veteran members
- Orientation events by membership stage
- Introduction circles at events
- Visual signaling (name tags, status)

These mechanisms must work together to be effective.

---

## Sustainability Constraints
SBNC must balance:
- New member growth
- Event capacity
- Volunteer availability
- Financial neutrality of events
- Leadership energy and continuity

Too many new members without capacity breaks the system.
Too many extensions without engagement weakens renewal value.

This is a flywheel, not a queue.

## Leadership Truths
- Not everything can grow at once
- Pausing growth is sometimes the healthiest move
- Unsold events are as dangerous as oversold ones
- Volunteer burnout is a leading indicator of failure

---

## What Success Looks Like
- New members attend at least one event quickly
- Members feel personally known
- Leaders feel safe making decisions
- Transitions happen without panic
- The club feels welcoming, not transactional
