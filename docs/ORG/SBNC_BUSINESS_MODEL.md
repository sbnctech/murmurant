## Purpose of This Document

This is the **canonical grounding document** for SBNC and ClubOS. All other documentation, system behavior, chatbot responses, and governance decisions should align with the principles stated here.

**This document MUST be referenced by:**
- Mentor role documentation
- Leadership Action Log documentation
- Chatbot contributor rules
- Officer onboarding materials
- Board orientation materials

## Part 1: What SBNC Is

SBNC is a **participation-driven nonprofit** whose success depends on converting new members into confident participants and eventually volunteers and leaders.

### The Member Journey

```
New Member
    |
    v
Confident Participant (attends events, feels welcome)
    |
    v
Volunteer (helps at events, mentors newbies)
    |
    v
Leader (chairs events, serves on committees, joins board)
```

This progression is not automatic. Fear, uncertainty, and lack of connection cause members to drop off at each stage. SBNC's job is to reduce friction at every transition.

### Why "Participation-Driven" Matters

Unlike organizations that measure success by membership count alone, SBNC measures success by:

1. **Event attendance** - Are members showing up?
2. **Return attendance** - Do first-time attendees come back?
3. **Volunteer pipeline** - Are participants stepping up to help?
4. **Leadership pipeline** - Are volunteers progressing to leadership?

A club with 500 members where 50 participate regularly is less healthy than a club with 200 members where 100 participate regularly.

---

## Part 2: The Flywheel

SBNC operates on a **flywheel model** where each part reinforces the others:

```
Events attract members
    |
    v
Members who participate feel connected
    |
    v
Connected members become volunteers
    |
    v
Volunteers enable more events
    |
    (cycles back to top)
```

### Breaking the Flywheel

The flywheel can stall or break at several points:

| Break Point | What Happens | Result |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| No events | Members have nothing to attend | Membership attrition |
| Events but no welcome | New members feel excluded | No return attendance |
| No volunteer pipeline | Same few people burn out | Event quality drops |
| No leadership pipeline | Board positions go unfilled | Governance gaps |

**Critical insight**: The flywheel is fragile at the "new member to confident participant" transition. This is why the Mentor role exists.

## Part 3: Financial Model

### The $50,000 Cash Buffer

SBNC deliberately maintains a **$50,000 cash buffer** at all times. This is not "extra money sitting around" - it is a strategic reserve that enables:

1. **Event commitment flexibility** - Can book venues before registration revenue arrives
2. **Bad-weather insurance** - Can absorb a canceled event without crisis
3. **Volunteer sustainability** - Can hire help when volunteers are stretched thin
4. **Opportunity response** - Can say yes to unexpected opportunities

### Surplus Spending Philosophy

When SBNC has surplus above the $50K buffer, the priority is **spending it to protect participation and volunteer sustainability**, not growing the buffer further.

Good uses of surplus:
- Subsidizing events to keep prices accessible
- Hiring temporary help to prevent volunteer burnout
- Investing in systems (like ClubOS) that reduce friction
- Training programs for volunteers and leaders

Bad uses of surplus:
- Building a larger buffer "just in case"
- Spending on things that don't increase participation
- Delaying spending until the money becomes a governance burden

## Part 4: The Third-Year Member Problem

### What Happens at Year Three

Research and experience show that members who reach their third year face a critical decision point:

- **Year 1**: Everything is new and exciting
- **Year 2**: Established friendships, regular attendance patterns
- **Year 3**: Plateau - "I've done most things, now what?"

At year three, members either:
1. **Deepen** - Take on volunteer or leadership roles
2. **Coast** - Continue attending but disengage emotionally
3. **Leave** - Drift away due to lack of new challenges

### Why This Matters

Third-year members are the ideal volunteer recruitment pool because they:
- Know how the club works
- Have established relationships
- Are looking for "what's next"

But if the club has no clear path for them, they leave - taking their institutional knowledge and potential leadership with them.

### ClubOS Response

ClubOS should help identify third-year members and surface them to leadership as volunteer recruitment candidates. The Mentor role is specifically designed as a low-barrier entry point for this group.

---

## Part 5: Fear as the Primary Barrier

### The Fear Inventory

New members and potential volunteers experience fear at multiple points:

| Situation | Fear | Result if Unaddressed |
|-----------|------|----------------------|
| First event | "Will I know anyone?" | No-shows, single attendance |
| Signing up for activity | "What if I'm not good enough?" | Under-registration |
| Being asked to volunteer | "What if I fail? What if it's too much?" | Volunteer shortage |
| Considering leadership | "What if I make a mistake? What if I'm not qualified?" | Leadership gaps |

### Fear Reduction as Strategy

SBNC's response to fear is not "tough it out" but "reduce the barrier":

- **First event fear** -> Mentor program assigns a friendly face
- **Activity fear** -> Clear expectations, beginner-friendly options
- **Volunteer fear** -> Low-commitment entry points (Mentor role)
- **Leadership fear** -> Training, shadowing, clear scope definitions

### ClubOS Role in Fear Reduction

ClubOS should:
1. **Normalize anxiety** - Acknowledge that uncertainty is normal
2. **Promote mentorship** - Surface mentor availability at friction points
3. **Provide clarity** - Clear information about what to expect
4. **Escalate uncertainty** - When unsure, ask rather than guess

---

## Part 6: Governance Principles

### Capability Over Role

Authorization in SBNC (and ClubOS) follows **capability-based** thinking:

- "Can this person do this specific thing?" (good)
- "Is this person an admin?" (bad)

This aligns with how SBNC actually works: a Treasurer can approve payments but not edit event descriptions; an Event Chair can manage their event but not access financial records.

### Transparency by Default

Members should be able to understand:
- How decisions are made
- Who has what authority
- What the club's financial position is
- Why policies exist

ClubOS supports this by making information accessible rather than hidden.

### Volunteer Sustainability Over Heroics

The club should not depend on any single volunteer working unsustainable hours. When workload exceeds volunteer capacity:

1. Reduce scope (fewer events, simpler processes)
2. Recruit more volunteers
3. Pay for help (using surplus)

"Burning out volunteers" is never an acceptable outcome, even if it means doing less.

---

## Part 7: How ClubOS Serves These Principles

ClubOS exists to:

1. **Reduce fear** - Clear information, mentor connections, normalized uncertainty
2. **Increase clarity** - Visible event details, registration status, volunteer opportunities
3. **Manage tension** - Balance event capacity, volunteer supply, and member demand
4. **Enable flywheel** - Track member journey, surface volunteer candidates, support mentorship

ClubOS does NOT exist to:

- Create bureaucracy
- Add friction to participation
- Concentrate power in technology gatekeepers
- Replace human judgment with automation

---

## Part 8: Frozen Decisions

The following strategic decisions have been made and should not be revisited
without explicit Board action:

### Mentor Role Decisions (Frozen)

1. **Mentor is a VOLUNTEER role** - It is a first-class volunteer position,
   not an informal helper or administrative classification.

2. **Mentor does NOT qualify for third-year membership by itself** - Serving as
   a Mentor does not count toward the volunteer service that extends third-year
   member benefits. This is intentional: Mentor is a gateway, not a destination.

3. **Mentor is the gateway to qualifying volunteer roles** - The Mentor role is
   designed as the low-barrier entry point. After mentoring, members are better
   prepared to take on qualifying volunteer positions.

4. **Mentor program is owned by VP Membership** - VP Membership is responsible
   for assigning mentors, tracking mentorship relationships, and coordinating
   mentor recognition.

### Open Questions for Human Review

The following questions remain open and are captured in
`docs/review/HUMAN_REVIEW_PACK.md`:

1. **What does "breaking the flywheel" look like in practice?**
   - What specific warning signs should trigger escalation?
   - At what point is the situation a board-level concern?
