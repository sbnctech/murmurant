# SBNC Business Model and Sustainability (Canonical Grounding)
Santa Barbara Newcomers Club (SBNC)

Purpose:
SBNC exists to help new residents thrive in Santa Barbara, their new home:
- Feel at home in Santa Barbara
- Know people
- Know their way around the community and resources
- Have a real community in Santa Barbara

## True North objectives
SBNC succeeds when:
- New members attend events soon after joining (the "first event" is the funnel gate).
- Members progress into deeper involvement:
  1) Events and social gatherings
  2) Small groups or committees
  3) Volunteering and leadership roles

If new members do not attend events and social gatherings, they never enter the funnel.

## The flywheel
The sustainability flywheel is:
New member joins -> First event attendance -> Repeat participation -> Low-risk volunteering -> Leadership -> Third-year membership incentive -> More capacity to run events -> Better first-event availability

Primary failure mode:
If "first event attendance" stalls, the entire system slows.

Barriers to first-event attendance:
- Lack of availability (events sold out)
- Not knowing which event is right
- Introversion and shyness

Operational countermeasures already in place:
1) Newbie tickets reserved and released near event date for recent joiners
2) Mentors program + orientations by membership level
3) "Introduction circle" at events + nametag signals for newbies + mentor escort effect

Known operational breakdowns to monitor:
- Newbie tickets not released at the right time
- Signals (name tags, status) not flowing through registration/email/events
- Members missing orientation events

## Managed participation economy (system view)
SBNC is a participation platform whose scarce resources are:
1) Volunteer capacity
2) Event slots (capacity)
3) Member confidence (especially early-stage)

Money matters as a stabilizer, not the objective.

### Financial equilibrium targets (configurable)
- Target end-of-term cash balance (default historical target: 50000). This must be configurable.
- Cash accounting.
- Financials close monthly (last day of each month).
- Budget is six-month term based; budget vs actuals are reviewed at every Board meeting.

Surplus policy:
- If membership revenue or events produce surpluses beyond the cash target, surplus should be intentionally spent to reach (not exceed) the target.
Typical uses:
- Technology and systems
- Professional services
- Fixed assets
- Event subsidies (reduce pricing pressure; reduce undersubscription risk; reduce stress on chairs)

Events economics clarification:
- Events can individually lose or make money.
- The goal for the term is "event neutrality":
  - Each committee and the club as a whole should neither make nor lose money from events over the term.

### Third-year members as a managed tension
Third-year membership:
- Adds non-event revenue (fee paid for third-year membership).
- Increases demand pressure on event capacity (typically the most active attendees).
- Acts as an incentive for volunteering/leadership (a meaningful reward for service).

Risk:
Too many third-year members (demand pressure) without matching volunteer growth (supply) can reduce newbie availability and break the flywheel.

## Mentorship as the first volunteering step
Mentor is the gateway volunteer role:
- Low risk
- Builds confidence
- Reduces fear of "breaking something"
- Increases future volunteer supply

Mentorship should be visible in member activity history and usable in third-year decisions.

## System requirements derived from this grounding
ClubOS should support:
- Newbie-first availability and signaling
- Mentorship matching workflow (VP Membership owned; immediate)
- Action logging that creates leadership confidence ("what is normal?")
- Dashboards to detect flywheel health and early red flags
- Financial guardrails aligned to configurable cash target and event neutrality
